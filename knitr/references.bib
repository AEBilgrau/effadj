abstract = {SUMMARY: The assessment of data quality is a major concern in microarray analysis. arrayQualityMetrics is a Bioconductor package that provides a report with diagnostic plots for one or two colour microarray data. The quality metrics assess reproducibility, identify apparent outlier arrays and compute measures of signal-to-noise ratio. The tool handles most current microarray technologies and is amenable to use in automated analysis pipelines or for automatic report generation, as well as for use by individuals. The diagnosis of quality remains, in principle, a context-dependent judgement, but our tool provides powerful, automated, objective and comprehensive instruments on which to base a decision. AVAILABILITY: arrayQualityMetrics is a free and open source package, under LGPL license, available from the Bioconductor project at www.bioconductor.org. A users guide and examples are provided with the package. Some examples of HTML reports generated by arrayQualityMetrics can be found at http://www.microarray-quality.org},

abstract = {In cancer studies, it is common that multiple microarray experiments are conducted to measure the same clinical outcome and expressions of the same set of genes. An important goal of such experiments is to identify a subset of genes that can potentially serve as predictive markers for cancer development and progression. Analyses of individual experiments may lead to unreliable gene selection results because of the small sample sizes. Meta analysis can be used to pool multiple experiments, increase statistical power, and achieve more reliable gene selection. The meta analysis of cancer microarray data is challenging because of the high dimensionality of gene expressions and the differences in experimental settings amongst different experiments.},

@article{Augustine2009,
abstract = {PURPOSE: Despite objective response rates of only approximately 13\%, temozolomide remains one of the most effective single chemotherapy agents against metastatic melanoma, second only to dacarbazine, the current standard of care for systemic treatment of melanoma. The goal of this study was to identify molecular and/or genetic markers that correlate with, and could be used to predict, response to temozolomide-based treatment regimens and that reflect the intrinsic properties of a patient's tumor. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using a panel of 26 human melanoma-derived cell lines, we determined in vitro temozolomide sensitivity, O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) activity, MGMT protein expression and promoter methylation status, and mismatch repair proficiency, as well as the expression profile of 38,000 genes using an oligonucleotide-based microarray platform. RESULTS: The results showed a broad spectrum of temozolomide sensitivity across the panel of cell lines, with IC(50) values ranging from 100 micromol/L to 1 mmol/L. There was a significant correlation between measured temozolomide sensitivity and a gene expression signature-derived prediction of temozolomide sensitivity (P < 0.005). Notably, MGMT alone showed a significant correlation with temozolomide sensitivity (MGMT activity, P < 0.0001; MGMT expression, P <or= 0.0001). The promoter methylation status of the MGMT gene, however, was not consistent with MGMT gene expression or temozolomide sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that melanoma resistance to temozolomide is conferred predominantly by MGMT activity and suggest that MGMT expression could potentially be a useful tool for predicting the response of melanoma patients to temozolomide therapy.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of clustering observations using a potentially large set of features. One might expect that the true underlying clusters present in the data differ only with respect to a small fraction of the features, and will be missed if one clusters the observations using the full set of features. We propose a novel framework for sparse clustering, in which one clusters the observations using an adaptively chosen subset of the features. The method uses a lasso-type penalty to select the features. We use this framework to develop simple methods for sparse K-means and sparse hierarchical clustering. A single criterion governs both the selection of the features and the resulting clusters. These approaches are demonstrated on simulated data and on genomic data sets.},

abstract = {Syndecan-1 is a proteoglycan that concentrates heparin-binding factors on the surface of multiple myeloma cells, and probably plays a major role in multiple myeloma biology. As heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate are the bioactive components of syndecan-1, we analysed the signature of genes encoding 100 proteins involved in synthesis of these chains, i.e. from precursor uptake to post-translational modifications, using Affymetrix microarrays. The expression of enzymes required for heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate biosynthesis was shown to increase in parallel with syndecan-1 expression, throughout the differentiation of memory B cells into plasmablasts and normal bone marrow plasma cells. Sixteen genes were significantly different between normal and malignant plasma cells, nine of these genes -EXT2, CHSY3, CSGALNACT1, HS3ST2, HS2ST1, CHST11, CSGALNACT2, HPSE, SULF2 - encode proteins involved in glycosaminoglycan chain synthesis or modifications. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed in two independent series of patients: B4GALT7, CSGALNACT1, HS2ST1 were associated with a good prognosis whereas EXT1 was linked to a bad prognosis. This study provides an overall picture of the major genes encoding for proteins involved in heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate synthesis and modifications that can be implicated in normal and malignant plasma cells.},

abstract = {Cancer-causing mutations disrupt coordinated, precise programs of gene expression that govern cell growth and differentiation. Microarray-based gene-expression profiling (GEP) is a powerful tool to globally analyze these changes to study cancer biology and clinical behavior. Despite overwhelming genomic chaos in multiple myeloma (MM), expression patterns within tumor samples are remarkably stable and reproducible. Unique expression patterns associated with recurrent chromosomal translocations and ploidy changes defined molecular classes with differing clinical features and outcomes. Combined molecular techniques also dissected two distinct, reproducible forms of hyperdiploid disease and have molecularly defined MM with high risk for poor clinical outcome. GEP is now used to risk-stratify patients with newly diagnosed MM. Groups with high-risk features are evident in all GEP-defined MM classes, and GEP studies of serial samples showed that risk increases over time, with relapsed disease showing dramatic GEP shifts toward a signature of poor outcomes. This suggests a common mechanism of disease evolution and potentially reflects preferential expansion of therapy-resistant cells. Correlating GEP-defined disease class and risk with outcomes of therapeutic regimens reveals class-specific benefits for individual agents, as well as mechanistic insights into drug sensitivity and resistance. Here, we review modern genomics contributions to understanding MM pathogenesis, prognosis, and therapy.},

abstract = {Classification using high-dimensional features arises frequently in many contemporary statistical studies such as tumor classification using microarray or other high-throughput data. The impact of dimensionality on classifications is largely poorly understood. In a seminal paper, Bickel and Levina (2004) show that the Fisher discriminant performs poorly due to diverging spectra and they propose to use the independence rule to overcome the problem. We first demonstrate that even for the independence classification rule, classification using all the features can be as bad as the random guessing due to noise accumulation in estimating population centroids in high-dimensional feature space. In fact, we demonstrate further that almost all linear discriminants can perform as bad as the random guessing. Thus, it is paramountly important to select a subset of important features for high-dimensional classification, resulting in Features Annealed Independence Rules (FAIR). The conditions under which all the important features can be selected by the two-sample t-statistic are established. The choice of the optimal number of features, or equivalently, the threshold value of the test statistics are proposed based on an upper bound of the classification error. Simulation studies and real data analysis support our theoretical results and demonstrate convincingly the advantage of our new classification procedure.},

abstract = {Substantial effort has been devoted to in vitro testing of candidate chemotherapeutic agents. In particular, the United States National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program (NCI-DTP) Human Tumor Cell Line Screen has screened hundreds of thousands of compounds and extracts, for which data on more than 40,000 compounds tested on a panel of 60 cancer cell lines (NCI-60) are publically available. In tandem, gene expression profiling has brought about a sea change in our understanding of cancer biology, allowing discovery of biomarkers or signatures able to characterize, classify, and prognosticate clinical behavior of human tumors. Recent studies have used tumor profiling matched to clinical trial outcome data to derive gene expression models predicting therapeutic outcomes, though such efforts are costly, time-consuming, tumor type-specific, and not amenable to rare diseases. Furthermore, addition of new or established drugs to multidrug combinations in which such models are already available requires the entire model to be re-derived. Can the aforementioned in vitro testing platform, coupled to the universal language of genomics, be used to develop, a priori, gene expression models predictive of clinical outcomes? Recent advances, including the CO-eXpression ExtrapolatioN (COXEN) algorithm, suggest that development of these models may be possible and raise important implications for future trial design and drug discovery.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Survival of patients with multiple myeloma is highly heterogeneous, from periods of a few weeks to more than 10 years. We used gene expression profiles of myeloma cells obtained at diagnosis to identify broadly applicable prognostic markers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a training set of 182 patients, we used supervised methods to identify individual genes associated with length of survival. A survival model was built from these genes. The validity of our model was assessed in our test set of 68 patients and in three independent cohorts comprising 853 patients with multiple myeloma. RESULTS: The 15 strongest genes associated with the length of survival were used to calculate a risk score and to stratify patients into low-risk and high-risk groups. The survival-predictor score was significantly associated with survival in both the training and test sets and in the external validation cohorts. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of rates of survival at 3 years were 90.5\% (95\% CI, 85.6\% to 95.3\%) and 47.4\% (95\% CI, 33.5\% to 60.1\%), respectively, in our patients having a low risk or high risk independently of traditional prognostic factors. High-risk patients constituted a homogeneous biologic entity characterized by the overexpression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and its surveillance, whereas low-risk patients were heterogeneous and displayed hyperdiploid signatures. CONCLUSION: Gene expression-based survival prediction and molecular features associated with high-risk patients may be useful for developing prognostic markers and may provide basis to treat these patients with new targeted antimitotics.},

abstract = {B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) is the most common malignancy in children. The Wnt signaling pathway has been found to be extensively involved in cancer onset and progression but its role in BCP-ALL remains controversial. We evaluate the role of the Wnt pathway in maintenance of BCP-ALL cells and resistance to chemotherapy. Gene expression profile revealed that BCP-ALL cells are potentially sensitive to modulation of Wnt pathway. Nalm-16 and Nalm-6 cell lines displayed low levels of canonical activation, as reflected by the virtually complete absence of total beta-catenin in Nalm-6 and the beta-catenin cell membrane distribution in Nalm-16 cell line. Canonical activation with Wnt3a induced nuclear beta-catenin translocation and led to BCP-ALL cell death. Lithium chloride (LiCl) also induced a cytotoxic effect on leukemic cells. In contrast, both Wnt5a and Dkk-1 increased Nalm-16 cell survival. Also, Wnt3a enhanced the in vitro sensitivity of Nalm-16 to etoposide (VP-16) while treatment with canonical antagonists protected leukemic cells from chemotherapy-induced cell death. Overall, our results suggest that canonical activation of the Wnt pathway may exerts a tumor suppressive effect, thus its inhibition may support BCP-ALL cell survival.},

abstract = {Microarray gene-expression data of 54 paired gastric cancer and adjacent noncancerous gastric tissues were analyzed, with the aim to establish gene signatures for cancer grades (well-, moderately-, poorly- or un-differentiated) and stages (I, II, III and IV), which have been determined by pathologists. Our statistical analysis led to the identification of a number of gene combinations whose expression patterns serve well as signatures of different grades and different stages of gastric cancer. A 19-gene signature was found to have discerning power between high- and low-grade gastric cancers in general, with overall classification accuracy at 79.6\%. An expanded 198-gene panel allows the stratification of cancers into four grades and control, giving rise to an overall classification agreement of 74.2\% between each grade designated by the pathologists and our prediction. Two signatures for cancer staging, consisting of 10 genes and 9 genes, respectively, provide high classification accuracies at 90.0\% and 84.0\%, among early-, advanced-stage cancer and control. Functional and pathway analyses on these signature genes reveal the significant relevance of the derived signatures to cancer grades and progression. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first study on identification of genes whose expression patterns can serve as markers for cancer grades and stages.},

abstract = {Partial least squares regression has been an alternative to ordinary least squares for handling multicollinearity in several areas of scientific research since the 1960s. It has recently gained much attention in the analysis of high dimensional genomic data. We show that known asymptotic consistency of the partial least squares estimator for a univariate response does not hold with the very large p and small n paradigm. We derive a similar result for a multivariate response regression with partial least squares. We then propose a sparse partial least squares formulation which aims simultaneously to achieve good predictive performance and variable selection by producing sparse linear combinations of the original predictors. We provide an efficient implementation of sparse partial least squares regression and compare it with well-known variable selection and dimension reduction approaches via simulation experiments. We illustrate the practical utility of sparse partial least squares regression in a joint analysis of gene expression and genomewide binding data.},

In this article we propose new time-dependent accuracy summaries based on time-specific versions of sensitivity and specificity calculated over risk sets. We connect the accuracy summaries to a previously proposed global concordance measure, which is a variant of Kendall's tau. In addition, we show how standard Cox regression output can be used to obtain estimates of time-dependent sensitivity and specificity, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Semiparametric estimation methods appropriate for both proportional and nonproportional hazards data are introduced, evaluated in simulations, and illustrated using two familiar survival data sets.},

Real-time PCR is easy to perform, provides the necessary accuracy and produces reliable as well as rapid quantification results. But accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis. This study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR of a target gene transcript in comparison to a reference gene transcript. Therefore, a new mathematical model is presented. The relative expression ratio is calculated only from the real-time PCR efficiencies and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. This model needs no calibration curve. Control levels were included in the model to standardise each reaction run with respect to RNA integrity, sample loading and inter-PCR variations. High accuracy and reproducibility (<2.5\% variation) were reached in LightCycler PCR using the established mathematical model.},

The problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a reader's ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments. CONTENT: The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. MIQE is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. MIQE details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement. SUMMARY: Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of qPCR results.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Myeloma is a clonal malignancy of plasma cells. Poor-prognosis risk is currently identified by clinical and cytogenetic features. However, these indicators do not capture all prognostic information. Gene expression analysis can be used to identify poor-prognosis patients and this can be improved by combination with information about DNA-level changes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using single nucleotide polymorphism-based gene mapping in combination with global gene expression analysis, we have identified homozygous deletions in genes and networks that are relevant to myeloma pathogenesis and outcome. RESULTS: We identified 170 genes with homozygous deletions and corresponding loss of expression. Deletion within the "cell death" network was overrepresented and cases with these deletions had impaired overall survival. From further analysis of these events, we have generated an expression-based signature associated with shorter survival in 258 patients and confirmed this signature in data from two independent groups totaling 800 patients. We defined a gene expression signature of 97 cell death genes that reflects prognosis and confirmed this in two independent data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a simple 6-gene expression signature from the 97-gene signature that can be used to identify poor-prognosis myeloma in the clinical environment. This signature could form the basis of future trials aimed at improving the outcome of poor-prognosis myeloma.},

abstract = {The U.S. National Cancer Institute has used a panel of 60 diverse human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) to screen >100,000 chemical compounds for anticancer activity. However, not all important cancer types are included in the panel, nor are drug responses of the panel predictive of clinical efficacy in patients. We asked, therefore, whether it would be possible to extrapolate from that rich database (or analogous ones from other drug screens) to predict activity in cell types not included or, for that matter, clinical responses in patients with tumors. We address that challenge by developing and applying an algorithm we term "coexpression extrapolation" (COXEN). COXEN uses expression microarray data as a Rosetta Stone for translating from drug activities in the NCI-60 to drug activities in any other cell panel or set of clinical tumors. Here, we show that COXEN can accurately predict drug sensitivity of bladder cancer cell lines and clinical responses of breast cancer patients treated with commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, we used COXEN for in silico screening of 45,545 compounds and identify an agent with activity against human bladder cancer.},

abstract = {Specific microRNA (miRNA) signatures have been associated with different cytogenetic subtypes in acute leukemias. This finding prompted us to investigate potential associations between genetic abnormalities in multiple myeloma (MM) and singular miRNA expression profiles. Moreover, global gene expression profiling was also analyzed to find correlated miRNA gene expression and select miRNA target genes that show such correlation. For this purpose, we analyzed the expression level of 365 miRNAs and the gene expression profiling in 60 newly diagnosed MM patients, selected to represent the most relevant recurrent genetic abnormalities. Supervised analysis showed significantly deregulated miRNAs in the different cytogenetic subtypes as compared with normal PC. It is interesting to note that miR-1 and miR-133a clustered on the same chromosomal loci, were specifically overexpressed in the cases with t(14;16). The analysis of the relationship between miRNA expression and their respective target genes showed a conserved inverse correlation between several miRNAs deregulated in MM cells and CCND2 expression level. These results illustrate, for the first time, that miRNA expression pattern in MM is associated with genetic abnormalities, and that the correlation of the expression profile of miRNA and their putative mRNA targets is useful to find statistically significant protein-coding genes in MM pathogenesis associated with changes in specific miRNAs.},

abstract = {Two oncogenic pathways have been hypothesized for multiple myeloma (MM) and premalignant monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) tumors: a nonhyperdiploid pathway associated with a high prevalence of IgH translocations and a hyperdiploid pathway associated with multiple trisomies of 8 chromosomes. Cyclin D1, D2, or D3 expression appears to be increased and/or dysregulated in virtually all MM tumors despite their low proliferative capacity. Translocations can directly dysregulate CCND1 (11q13) or CCND3 (6p21), or MAF (16q23) or MAFB (20q11) transcription factors that target CCND2. Biallelic dysregulation of CCND1 occurs in nearly 40\% of tumors, most of which are hyperdiploid. Other tumors express increased CCND2, either with or without a t(4;14) translocation. Using gene expression profiling to identify 5 recurrent translocations, specific trisomies, and expression of cyclin D genes, MM tumors can be divided into 8 TC (translocation/cyclin D) groups (11q13, 6p21, 4p16, maf, D1, D1+D2, D2, and none) that appear to be defined by early, and perhaps initiating, oncogenic events. However, despite subsequent progression events, these groups have differing gene expression profiles and also significant differences in the prevalence of bone disease, frequency at relapse, and progression to extramedullary tumor.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Heart failure affects more than 20 million people in the world. Heart transplantation is the most effective therapy, but the number of eligible patients far outweighs the number of available donor hearts. The left mechanical ventricular assist device (LVAD) has been developed as a successful substitution therapy that aids the failing ventricle while a patient is waiting for the donor heart. We obtained genomics data from paired human heart samples harvested at the time of LVAD implant and explant. The heart failure patients in our study were supported by the LVAD for various periods of time. The goal of this study is to model the relationship between the time of LVAD support and gene expression changes. RESULTS: To serve the purpose, we propose a novel penalized partial least squares (PPLS) method to build a regression model. Compared with partial least squares and Breiman's random forest method, PPLS gives the best prediction results for the LVAD data.},

abstract = {The assembly of MHC class I molecules is governed by stringent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control mechanisms. MHC class I heavy chains that fail to achieve their native conformation in complex with $\beta$2-microglobulin ($\beta$2m) and peptide are targeted for ER-associated degradation. This requires ubiquitination of the MHC class I heavy chain and its dislocation from the ER to the cytosol for proteasome-mediated degradation, although the cellular machinery involved in this process is unknown. Using an siRNA functional screen in $\beta$2m-depleted cells, we identify an essential role for the E3 ligase HRD1 (Synoviolin) together with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2J1 in the ubiquitination and dislocation of misfolded MHC class I heavy chains. HRD1 is also required for the ubiquitination and degradation of the naturally occurring hemochromatosis-associated HFE-C282Y mutant, which is unable to bind $\beta$2m. In the absence of HRD1, misfolded HLA-B27 accumulated in cells with a normal MHC class I assembly pathway, and HRD1 depletion prevented the appearance of low levels of cytosolic unfolded MHC I heavy chains. HRD1 and UBE2J1 associate in a complex together with non-$\beta$2m bound MHC class I heavy chains, Derlin 1, and p97 and discriminate misfolded MHC class I from conformational MHC I-$\beta$2m-peptide heterotrimers. Together these data support a physiological role for HRD1 and UBE2J1 in the homeostatic regulation of MHC class I assembly and expression.},

abstract = {We present data describing a human myeloma cell line (8226/LR-5) selected for resistance to melphalan which exhibits a 7-fold level of resistance to melphalan and is partially cross-resistant to other bifunctional alkylators and X-irradiation. Melphalan resistance is relatively unstable with a decrease in resistance observed within 17 weeks in the absence of drug. The resistance observed in this cell line is not mediated by reduced intracellular melphalan accumulation. DNA interstrand cross-linking at equivalent intracellular drug accumulation is significantly reduced in the resistant subline. Whether this reduction is the result of a decrease in the formation of this lesion or to an increased rate of removal of the lesion remains to be determined. Growth characteristics and cell cycle kinetics, including S phase, were similar between sensitive and resistant cell lines. Intracellular nonprotein thiols were found to be significantly elevated in the resistant 8226/LR-5 cells; as cells revert or lose resistance, intracellular nonprotein sulfhydryl levels decline. Prior treatment of the cells with buthionine sulfoximine significantly reduced nonprotein sulfhydryl levels and enhanced melphalan cytotoxicity in both the sensitive and resistant cell lines. Thiols appear to play a role in mediating melphalan resistance.},

abstract = {Understanding the systemic biological pathways and the key cellular mechanisms that dictate disease states, drug response, and altered cellular function poses a significant challenge. Although high-throughput measurement techniques, such as transcriptional profiling, give some insight into the altered state of a cell, they fall far short of providing by themselves a complete picture. Some improvement can be made by using enrichment-based methods to, for example, organize biological data of this sort into collections of dysregulated pathways. However, such methods arguably are still limited to primarily a transcriptional view of the cell. Augmenting these methods still further with networks and additional -omics data has been found to yield pathways that play more fundamental roles. We propose a previously undescribed method for identification of such pathways that takes a more direct approach to the problem than any published to date. Our method, called latent pathway identification analysis (LPIA), looks for statistically significant evidence of dysregulation in a network of pathways constructed in a manner that implicitly links pathways through their common function in the cell. We describe the LPIA methodology and illustrate its effectiveness through analysis of data on (i) metastatic cancer progression, (ii) drug treatment in human lung carcinoma cells, and (iii) diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. With these analyses, we show that LPIA can successfully identify pathways whose perturbations have latent influences on the transcriptionally altered genes.},

abstract = {The TRE17 (USP6/TRE-2) oncogene induces tumorigenesis in both humans and mice. However, little is known regarding its regulation or mechanism of transformation. TRE17 encodes a TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16)/Rab GTPase-activating protein homology domain at its N terminus and a ubiquitin-specific protease at its C terminus. In the current study, we identified the ubiquitous calcium (Ca2+)-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) as a novel binding partner for TRE17. CaM bound directly to TRE17 in a Ca2+-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. The CaM-binding site was mapped to two hydrophobic motifs near the C terminus of the TBC domain. Point mutations within these motifs significantly reduced the interaction of TRE17 with CaM. We further found that TRE17 is monoubiquitinated and promotes its own deubiquitination in vivo. CaM binding-deficient mutants of TRE17 exhibited significantly reduced monoubiquitination, suggesting that binding of Ca2+/CaM to TRE17 promotes this modification. Consistent with this notion, treatment of cells with the CaM inhibitor W7 reduced levels of TRE17 monoubiquitination. Interestingly, the calcium ionophore A23187 induced accumulation of a polyubiquitinated TRE17 species. The effect of A23187 was attenuated in CaM binding-deficient mutants of TRE17. Taken together, these studies indicate a role for Ca2+/CaM in regulating ubiquitination through direct interaction with TRE17.},

We identified modules of highly coexpressed genes, some of which are restricted to a single lineage but most of which are expressed at variable levels across multiple lineages. We found densely interconnected cis-regulatory circuits and a large number of transcription factors that are differentially expressed across hematopoietic states.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Standard treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) includes the use of a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. However, response rates are highly variable. Newer agents, such as pemetrexed, have shown significant activity as second-line therapy and are currently being evaluated in the front-line setting. We utilized a genomic strategy to develop signatures predictive of chemotherapeutic response to both cisplatin and pemetrexed to provide a rational approach to effective individualized medicine. METHODS: Using in vitro drug sensitivity data, coupled with microarray data, we developed gene expression signatures predicting sensitivity to cisplatin and pemetrexed. Signatures were validated with response data from 32 independent ovarian and lung cancer cell lines as well as 59 samples from patients previously treated with cisplatin. RESULTS: Genomic-derived signatures of cisplatin and pemetrexed sensitivity were shown to accurately predict sensitivity in vitro and, in the case of cisplatin, to predict treatment response in patients treated with cisplatin. The accuracy of the cisplatin predictor, based on available clinical data, was 83.1\% (sensitivity, 100\%; specificity 57\%; positive predictive value, 78\%; negative predictive value, 100\%). Interestingly, an inverse correlation was seen between in vitro cisplatin and pemetrexed sensitivity, and importantly, between the likelihood of cisplatin and pemetrexed response in patients. CONCLUSION: The use of genomic predictors of response to cisplatin and pemetrexed can be incorporated into strategies to optimize therapy for advanced solid tumors.},

abstract = {Melphalan, a DNA cross-linker, is one of the most widely used and effective drugs in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). In this report, we demonstrate that enhanced interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair via the Fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA pathway contributes to acquired drug resistance in melphalan-resistant myeloma cell lines, and disruption of this pathway reverses drug resistance. Using the alkaline comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis), we observed that melphalan-resistant cells have reduced ICL formation and enhanced ICL repair compared with melphalan-sensitive cells. Cell-cycle studies demonstrated that enhanced ICL repair released cells from melphalan-induced cell-cycle delay. Using siRNA to knock down FANCF in 8226/LR5 and U266/LR6 drug-resistant cells demonstrated a direct relationship between ICL repair capacity and drug sensitivity. Overexpression of FANCF in 8226/S and U266/S drug-sensitive cells partially reproduced the drug-resistant phenotype. These data show that enhanced DNA repair via the Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway is involved in acquired melphalan resistance. Our findings provide for a new target to enhance response to DNA cross-linking agents in cancer treatment.},

abstract = {The statistical treatment for hypothesis testing using real-time PCR data is a challenge for quantification of gene expression. One has to consider two key factors in precise statistical analysis of real-time PCR data: a well-defined statistical model and the integration of amplification efficiency (AE) into the model. Previous publications in real-time PCR data analysis often fall short in integrating the AE into the model. Novel, user-friendly, and universal AE-integrated statistical methods were developed for real-time PCR data analysis with four goals. First, we addressed the definition of AE, introduced the concept of efficiency-adjusted Delta Delta Ct, and developed a general mathematical method for its calculation. Second, we developed several linear combination approaches for the estimation of efficiency adjusted Delta Delta Ct and statistical significance for hypothesis testing based on different mathematical formulae and experimental designs. Statistical methods were also adopted to estimate the AE and its equivalence among the samples. A weighted Delta Delta Ct method was introduced to analyze the data with multiple internal controls. Third, we implemented the linear models with SAS programs and analyzed a set of data for each model. In order to allow other researchers to use and compare different approaches, SAS programs are included in the Supporting Information. Fourth, the results from analysis of different statistical models were compared and discussed. Our results underline the differences between the efficiency adjusted Delta Delta Ct methods and previously published methods, thereby better identifying and controlling the source of errors introduced by real-time PCR data analysis.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM) comprise heterogeneous disorders with incompletely understood molecular defects and variable clinical features. We performed gene expression profiling (GEP) with microarray data to better dissect the molecular phenotypes, sensitivity to particular chemotherapeutic agents, and prognoses of these diseases. METHODS: Using gene expression and clinical data from 877 patients ranging from normal plasma cells (NPC) to relapsed MM (RMM), we applied gene expression signatures reflecting deregulation of oncogenic pathways and tumor microenvironment to highlight molecular changes that occur as NPCs transition to MM, create a high-risk MGUS gene signature, and subgroup International Staging System (ISS) stages into more prognostically accurate clusters of patients. Lastly, we used gene signatures to predict sensitivity to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies among identified clusters of patients. RESULTS: Myc upregulation and increasing chromosomal instability (CIN) characterized the evolution from NPC to RMM (P < .0001 for both). Studies of MGUS revealed that some samples shared biologic features with RMM, which comprised the basis for a high-risk MGUS signature. Regarding MM, we subclassified ISS stages into clusters based on shared features of tumor biology. These clusters differentiated themselves based on predictions for prognosis and chemotherapy sensitivity (eg, in ISS stage I, one cluster was characterized by increased CIN, cyclophosphamide resistance, and a poor prognosis). CONCLUSION: GEP provides insight into the molecular defects underlying plasma cell dyscrasias that may explain their clinical heterogeneity. GEP also may also refine current prognostic and therapeutic models for MGUS and MM.},

abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of plasma cells with complex molecular characteristics that evolves from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, a highly prevalent premalignant condition. MM is the second most frequent hematologic cancer in the United States, and it remains incurable, thereby highlighting the need for new therapeutic approaches, particularly those targeting common molecular pathways involved in disease progression and maintenance, shared across different MM subtypes. Here we report that Wnt/beta-catenin is one such pathway. We document the involvement of beta-catenin in cell-cycle regulation, proliferation, and invasion contributing to enhanced proliferative and metastatic properties of MM. The pleiotropic effects of beta-catenin in MM correlate with its transcriptional function, and we demonstrate regulation of a novel target gene, Aurora kinase A, implicating beta-catenin in G2/M regulation. beta-catenin and Aurora kinase A are present in most MM but not in normal plasma cells and are expressed in a pattern that parallels progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to MM. Our data provide evidence for a novel functional link between beta-catenin and Aurora kinase A, underscoring a critical role of these pathways in MM disease progression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: ET-743 (trabectedin, Yondelis) and PM00104 (Zalypsis) are marine derived compounds that have antitumor activity. ET-743 and PM00104 exposure over sustained periods of treatment will result in the development of drug resistance, but the mechanisms which lead to resistance are not yet understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Human chondrosarcoma cell lines resistant to ET-743 (CS-1/ER) or PM00104 (CS-1/PR) were established in this study. The CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR exhibited cross resistance to cisplatin and methotrexate but not to doxorubicin. Human Affymetrix Gene Chip arrays were used to examine relative gene expression in these cell lines. We found that a large number of genes have altered expression levels in CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR when compared to the parental cell line. 595 CS-1/ER and 498 CS-1/PR genes were identified as overexpressing; 856 CS-1/ER and 874 CS-1/PR transcripts were identified as underexpressing. Three zinc finger protein (ZNF) genes were on the top 10 overexpressed genes list. These genes have not been previously associated with drug resistance in tumor cells. Differential expressions of ZNF93 and ZNF43 genes were confirmed in both CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR resistant cell lines by real-time RT-PCR. ZNF93 was overexpressed in two ET-743 resistant Ewing sarcoma cell lines as well as in a cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cell line, but was not overexpressed in paclitaxel resistant cell lines. ZNF93 knockdown by siRNA in CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR caused increased sensitivity for ET-743, PM00104, and cisplatin. Furthermore, ZNF93 transfected CS-1 cells are relatively resistant to ET-743, PM00104 and cisplatin. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests that zinc finger proteins, and ZNF93 in particular, are involved in resistance to ET-743 and PM00104.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.

abstract = {There is a considerable variation in efficacy of melphalan therapy in multiple myeloma (MM) and other hematopoietic tumors. We hypothesized that this may be due to variations in the expression of influx and efflux transporters of melphalan. We measured the expression of the influx transporters LAT1, LAT2, and TAT1 and the efflux transporters MDR1, MRP1 and BCRP by quantitative RT-PCR and related their expression to the intracellular accumulation and cytotoxicity of melphalan in 7 MM and 21 non-MM hematopoietic tumor cell lines. Variation in the intracellular accumulation accounted for nearly half of the variation in the cytotoxicity of melphalan in MM cell lines (r(2)=0.47, P=0.04). High expression of the efflux transporter MDR1 was associated with low intracellular accumulation and low cytotoxicity of melphalan (r(2)=0.56, P=0.03 and r(2)=0.62, P=0.02, respectively). The effect was reversed by the MDR1 inhibitor cyclosporine. In addition, the MDR1 overexpressing HL-60 cell line showed 10-fold higher resistance to melphalan than the non-MDR1 expressing one. Again, the resistance was reversed by cyclosporine and by MDR1-specific shRNA. LAT1 was the major influx transporter in tumor cell lines with 4000-fold higher expression than LAT2. Down-regulation of LAT1 by siRNA reduced the melphalan uptake by 58\% and toxicity by 3.5-fold, but natural variation in expression between the tumor cell lines was not associated with accumulation or cytotoxicity of melphalan. In conclusion, tumor-specific variations in the expression of the efflux transporter MDR1, but not of the influx transporter LAT1, affect the intracellular accumulation of melphalan and thus determine its cytotoxicity.},

abstract = {Accurate normalization is an absolute prerequisite for correct measurement of gene expression. For quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), the most commonly used normalization strategy involves standardization to a single constitutively expressed control gene. However, in recent years, it has become clear that no single gene is constitutively expressed in all cell types and under all experimental conditions, implying that the expression stability of the intended control gene has to be verified before each experiment. We outline a novel, innovative, and robust strategy to identify stably expressed genes among a set of candidate normalization genes. The strategy is rooted in a mathematical model of gene expression that enables estimation not only of the overall variation of the candidate normalization genes but also of the variation between sample subgroups of the sample set. Notably, the strategy provides a direct measure for the estimated expression variation, enabling the user to evaluate the systematic error introduced when using the gene. In a side-by-side comparison with a previously published strategy, our model-based approach performed in a more robust manner and showed less sensitivity toward coregulation of the candidate normalization genes. We used the model-based strategy to identify genes suited to normalize quantitative RT-PCR data from colon cancer and bladder cancer. These genes are UBC, GAPD, and TPT1 for the colon and HSPCB, TEGT, and ATP5B for the bladder. The presented strategy can be applied to evaluate the suitability of any normalization gene candidate in any kind of experimental design and should allow more reliable normalization of RT-PCR data.},

Southern analysis of MM.1 detected a rearrangement of the lambda-light chain gene, and Northern analysis revealed high levels of lambda gene expression. Cytogenetic analysis of the MM.1 cell line revealed the presence of seven related chromosomally abnormal cell lines characterized by numerical and structural aberrations, and it revealed five nonclonal abnormal cells.

abstract = {Gene expression profiling (GEP) has stratified diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) into molecular subgroups that correspond to different stages of lymphocyte development-namely germinal center B-cell like and activated B-cell like. This classification has prognostic significance, but GEP is expensive and not readily applicable into daily practice, which has lead to immunohistochemical algorithms proposed as a surrogate for GEP analysis. We assembled tissue microarrays from 475 de novo DLBCL patients who were treated with rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy. All cases were successfully profiled by GEP on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Sections were stained with antibodies reactive with CD10, GCET1, FOXP1, MUM1 and BCL6 and cases were classified following a rationale of sequential steps of differentiation of B cells. Cutoffs for each marker were obtained using receiver-operating characteristic curves, obviating the need for any arbitrary method. An algorithm based on the expression of CD10, FOXP1 and BCL6 was developed that had a simpler structure than other recently proposed algorithms and 92.6\% concordance with GEP. In multivariate analysis, both the International Prognostic Index and our proposed algorithm were significant independent predictors of progression-free and overall survival. In conclusion, this algorithm effectively predicts prognosis of DLBCL patients matching GEP subgroups in the era of rituximab therapy.},

abstract = {During 1985-1990 the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI) phased out its murine leukemia P388 anticancer drug screening program and developed as the replacement a new in vitro primary screen based upon a diverse panel of human tumor cell lines. For each substance tested, the screen generates a remarkably reproducible and characteristic profile of differential in vitro cellular sensitivity, or lack thereof, across the 60 different cell lines comprising the panel. Several investigational approaches to display, analysis, and interpretation of such profiles and databases, derived from the testing of tens of thousands of substances during the past 4-5 years since the NCI screen became fully operational, have been explored. A variety of useful, practical applications of the in vitro screen have become apparent. As these applications continue to evolve, they are proving to be complementary to diverse other anticancer screening and drug discovery strategies being developed or pursued elsewhere. Reviewed herein are some practical considerations and selected specific examples, particularly illustrating research applications of the NCI screen that may be more broadly applicable to the search for new anticancer drug development leads with novel profiles of antitumor activity and/or mechanisms of action. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplasm of a terminally differentiated B-cell. The disease is progressive and always lethal characterized by the slow proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. Much of our current understanding of the biology of MM has been obtained by studying MM-derived cell lines. Human myeloma cell lines were shown to be suitable model systems for use in various fields of the biological sciences. However, it has proved very difficult to establish cell lines from plasma cell dyscrasias. Most reported MM cell lines have been derived from patients with advanced disease and from extramedullary sites. Nevertheless, within the last 20 years more than 100 cell lines have been established. A significant portion of this panel is partially or well characterized with regard to their cell culture, clinical, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and functional features. Distinct immunoprofiles could be assigned to MM cell lines. All MM cell lines display chromosomal aberrations; in more than 80\% of the cell lines analyzed, chromosome 14 band q32 (immunoglobulin heavy chain locus) is affected; the various types of 14q+ chromosomes showed different distributions among the MM cell lines. A large percentage of MM cell lines is constitutively interleukin-6-dependent or responsive to various cytokines. It is important to realize that not every cell line established from a patient with myeloma is a neoplastic cell line. So-called 'myeloma cell lines' have been previously reported and are still widely used which are in reality Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. The presence of the EBV-genome in residual normal B-cells provides them with a selective growth advantage after explantation. In summary, a significant number of authentic and well-characterized MM cell lines has been established and described. The availability of these bona fide MM cell lines is of great importance for the study of the biology, etiology and treatment of the disease.},

abstract = {Most cancer treatments benefit only a minority of patients. This has led to a widespread interest in the identification of gene-expression-based prognostic signatures. Well-developed and validated genomic signatures can lead to personalized treatment decisions resulting in improved patient management. However, the pace of acceptance of these signatures in clinical practice has been slow. This is because many of the signatures have been developed without clear focus on the intended clinical use, and proper independent validation studies establishing their medical utility have rarely been performed. The practicing physician and the patient are thus left in doubt about the reliability and medical utility of the signatures. We aim to provide guidance to physicians in critically evaluating published studies on prognostic gene-expression signatures so that they are better equipped to decide which signatures, if any, have sufficient merit for use, in conjunction with other factors in helping their patients to make good treatment decisions. A discussion of the lessons to be learned from the successful development of the Oncotype DX((R)) genetic test for breast cancer is presented and contrasted with a review of the current status of prognostic gene-expression signatures in non-small-cell lung cancer.},

abstract = {Melphalan is widely used as a preparative agent in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). Although disease relapse is the major cause of death after a melphalan-conditioned autograft, the mechanism remains unclear. Melphalan produces a number of DNA adducts with the DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) considered to be the critical cytotoxic lesion. By using a modification of the single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay, we have measured formation and repair of DNA ICL in plasma cells from melphalan- naive and melphalan-treated patients (ie, those who have relapsed after a melphalan-conditioned autologous SCT or oral melphalan therapy). Similar levels of dose-dependent DNA interstand crosslinking were observed in cells from both melphalan-naive and -treated patients. However, marked differences in ICL repair were observed: cells from naive patients showed no repair, whereas those from treated patients exhibited between 42\% and 100\% repair at 40 hours. In vitro sensitivity to melphalan in plasma cells was found to correlate with ICL repair. These findings suggest that ICL repair may be an important mechanism by which melphalan resistance emerges after autologous SCT or oral therapy. This mechanism may have implications for MM patients undergoing melphalan therapy.},

abstract = {By a tblastn search with beta 1,4-galactosyltransferases as query sequences, we found an expressed sequence tag that showed similarity in beta 1,4-glycosyltransferase motifs. The full-length complementary DNA was obtained by a method of 5'-rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends. The predicted open reading frame encodes a typical type II membrane protein comprising 543 amino acids, the sequence of which was highly homologous to chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (CSGalNAcT-1), and we designated this novel enzyme CSGalNAcT-2. CSGalNAcT-2 showed much stronger N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity toward glucuronic acid of chondroitin poly- and oligosaccharides, and chondroitin sulfate poly- and oligosaccharides with a beta 1-4 linkage, i.e. elongation activity for chondroitin and chondroitin sulfate, but showed much weaker activity toward a tetrasaccharide of the glycosaminoglycan linkage structure (GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-O-methoxyphenyl), i.e. initiation activity, than CSGalNAcT-1. Transfection of the CSGalNAcT-1 gene into Chinese hamster ovary cells yielded a change of glycosaminoglycan composition, i.e. the replacement of heparan sulfate on a syndecan-4/fibroblast growth factor-1 chimera protein by chondroitin sulfate, however, transfection of the CSGalNAcT-2 gene did not. The above results indicated that CSGalNAcT-1 is involved in the initiation of chondroitin sulfate synthesis, whereas CSGalNAcT-2 participates mainly in the elongation, not initiation. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that CSGalNAcT-2 transcripts were highly expressed in the small intestine, leukocytes, and spleen, however, both CSGalNAcTs were ubiquitously expressed in various tissues.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously described gene-expression signatures that predict growth inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of common chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. The aim of this study was to confirm the validity of these gene-expression signatures in a large series of patients with oestrogen-receptor-negative breast tumours who were treated in a phase III neoadjuvant clinical trial. METHODS: This trial compares a non-taxane regimen (fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide [FEC] for six cycles) with a taxane regimen (docetaxel for three cycles followed by epirubicin plus docetaxel [TET] for three cycles) in women with oestrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer. The primary endpoint of the study is the difference in progression-free survival based on TP53 status and will be reported later. Predicting response with gene signatures was a planned secondary endpoint of the trial and is reported here. Pathological complete response, defined as complete disappearance of the tumour with no more than a few scattered tumour cells detected by the pathologist in the resection specimen, was used to assess chemosensitivity. RNA was prepared from sections of frozen biopsies taken at diagnosis and hybridised to Affymetrix X3P microarrays. In-vitro single-agent drug sensitivity signatures were combined to obtain FEC and TET regimen-specific signatures. This study is registered on the clinical trials site of the US National Cancer Institute website http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00017095. FINDINGS: Of 212 patients with oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours assessed, 87 patients were excluded. 125 oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours (55 that showed pathological complete responses) were tested: 66 in the FEC group (28 that showed pathological complete responses) and 59 in the TET group (27 that showed pathological complete responses). The regimen-specific signatures significantly predicted pathological complete response in patients treated with the appropriate regimen (p<0.0001). The FEC predictor had a sensitivity of 96\% (27 of 28 patients [95\% CI 82-99]), specificity of 66\% (25 of 38 patients [50-79]), positive predictive value (PPV) of 68\% (27 of 40 patients [52-80]), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 96\% (25 of 26 patients [81-99]). The TET predictor had a sensitivity of 93\% (25 of 27 patients [77-98]), specificity 69\% (22 of 32 patients [51-82]), PPV of 71\% (25 of 35 patients [55-84]), and NPV of 92\% (22 of 24 patients [74-98]). Analysis of tumour size, grade, nodal status, age, and regimen-specific signatures showed that the genomic signatures were the only independent variables predicting pathological complete response at p<0.01. Selection of patients with these signatures would increase the proportion of patients with pathological complete responses from 44\% to around 70\% in the patients studied here. INTERPRETATION: We have validated the use of regimen-specific drug sensitivity signatures in the context of a multicentre randomised trial. The high NPV of both signatures may allow early selection of patients with breast cancer who should be considered for trials with new drugs.},

abstract = {The choice of therapy for metastatic cancer is largely empirical because of a lack of chemosensitivity prediction for available combination chemotherapeutic regimens. Here, we identify molecular models of bladder carcinoma chemosensitivity based on gene expression for three widely used chemotherapeutic agents: cisplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine. We measured the growth inhibition elicited by these three agents in a series of 40 human urothelial cancer cell lines and correlated the GI(50) (50\% of growth inhibition) values with quantitative measures of global gene expression to derive models of chemosensitivity using a misclassification-penalized posterior approach. The misclassification-penalized posterior-derived models predicted the growth response of human bladder cancer cell lines to each of the three agents with sensitivities of between 0.93 and 0.96. We then developed an in silico approach to predict the cellular growth responses for each of these agents in the clinically relevant two-agent combinations. These predictions were prospectively evaluated on a series of 15 randomly chosen bladder carcinoma cell lines. Overall, 80\% of the predicted combinations were correct (P = 0.0002). Together, our results suggest that chemosensitivity to drug combinations can be predicted based on molecular models and provide the framework for evaluation of such models in patients undergoing combination chemotherapy for cancer. If validated in vivo, such predictive models have the potential to guide therapeutic choice at the level of an individual's tumor.},

abstract = {To better define the molecular basis of multiple myeloma (MM), we performed unsupervised hierarchic clustering of mRNA expression profiles in CD138-enriched plasma cells from 414 newly diagnosed patients who went on to receive high-dose therapy and tandem stem cell transplants. Seven disease subtypes were validated that were strongly influenced by known genetic lesions, such as c-MAF- and MAFB-, CCND1- and CCND3-, and MMSET-activating translocations and hyperdiploidy. Indicative of the deregulation of common pathways by gene orthologs, common gene signatures were observed in cases with c-MAF and MAFB activation and CCND1 and CCND3 activation, the latter consisting of 2 subgroups, one characterized by expression of the early B-cell markers CD20 and PAX5. A low incidence of focal bone disease distinguished one and increased expression of proliferation-associated genes of another novel subgroup. Comprising varying fractions of each of the other 6 subgroups, the proliferation subgroup dominated at relapse, suggesting that this signature is linked to disease progression. Proliferation and MMSET-spike groups were characterized by significant overexpression of genes mapping to chromosome 1q, and both exhibited a poor prognosis relative to the other groups. A subset of cases with a predominating myeloid gene expression signature, excluded from the profiling analyses, had more favorable baseline characteristics and superior prognosis to those lacking this signature.},

abstract = {ROC curves are a popular method for displaying sensitivity and specificity of a continuous diagnostic marker, X, for a binary disease variable, D. However, many disease outcomes are time dependent, D(t), and ROC curves that vary as a function of time may be more appropriate. A common example of a time-dependent variable is vital status, where D(t) = 1 if a patient has died prior to time t and zero otherwise. We propose summarizing the discrimination potential of a marker X, measured at baseline (t = 0), by calculating ROC curves for cumulative disease or death incidence by time t, which we denote as ROC(t). A typical complexity with survival data is that observations may be censored. Two ROC curve estimators are proposed that can accommodate censored data. A simple estimator is based on using the Kaplan-Meier estimator for each possible subset X > c. However, this estimator does not guarantee the necessary condition that sensitivity and specificity are monotone in X. An alternative estimator that does guarantee monotonicity is based on a nearest neighbor estimator for the bivariate distribution function of (X, T), where T represents survival time (Akritas, M. J., 1994, Annals of Statistics 22, 1299-1327). We present an example where ROC(t) is used to compare a standard and a modified flow cytometry measurement for predicting survival after detection of breast cancer and an example where the ROC(t) curve displays the impact of modifying eligibility criteria for sample size and power in HIV prevention trials.},

The results are suggestive a hierarchical, scale-free network, where a few highly interconnected genes (hubs) account for most of the interactions. Validation of the network against available data led to the identification of MYC as a major hub, which controls a network comprising known target genes as well as new ones, which were biochemically validated. The newly identified MYC targets include some major hubs. This approach can be generally useful for the analysis of normal and pathologic networks in mammalian cells.},

abstract = {The Fanconi anemia/BRCA (FA/BRCA) DNA damage repair pathway plays a pivotal role in the cellular response to replicative stress induced by DNA alkylating agents and greatly influences drug response in cancer treatment. We recently reported that FA/BRCA genes are overexpressed and causative for drug resistance in human melphalan-resistant multiple myeloma cell lines. However, the transcriptional regulation of the FA/BRCA pathway is not understood. In this report, we describe for the first time a novel function of the NF-kappaB subunits, RelB/p50, as transcriptional activators of the FA/BRCA pathway. Specifically, our findings point to constitutive phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase alpha and subsequent alterations in FANCD2 expression and function as underlying events leading to melphalan resistance in repeatedly exposed multiple myeloma cells. Inhibiting NF-kappaB by small interfering RNA, blocking the IkappaB kinase complex with BMS-345541, or using the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib drastically reduced FA/BRCA gene expression and FANCD2 protein expression in myeloma cells, resulting in diminished DNA damage repair and enhanced melphalan sensitivity. Importantly, we also found that bortezomib decreases FA/BRCA gene expression in multiple myeloma patients. These results show for the first time that NF-kappaB transcriptionally regulates the FA/BRCA pathway and provide evidence for targeting Fanconi anemia-mediated DNA repair to enhance chemotherapeutic response and circumvent drug resistance in myeloma patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B-cell malignancy characterized by a variable clinical course. Several parameters have prognostic capabilities but are associated with altered response to therapy in only a small subset of patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used gene expression profiling methods to generate predictors of therapy response and prognosis. Genomic signatures that reflect progressive disease and responses to chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy were created using cancer cell lines and patient leukemia cell samples. We validated and applied these three signatures to independent clinical data from four cohorts, representing a total of 301 CLL patients. RESULTS: A genomic signature of prognosis created from patient leukemic cell gene expression data coupled with clinical parameters significantly differentiated patients with stable disease from those with progressive disease in the training data set. The progression signature was validated in two independent data sets, showing a capacity to accurately identify patients at risk for progressive disease. In addition, genomic signatures that predict response to chlorambucil or pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab were generated and could accurately distinguish responding and nonresponding CLL patients. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, microarray analysis of CLL lymphocytes can be used to refine prognosis and predict response to different therapies. These results have implications for standard and investigational therapeutics in CLL patients.},

Recent evidence implicates a substantial commitment of the cellular DNA damage response machinery to the synthesis, recognition, and hydrolysis of ubiquitin chains at DNA damage sites. In this review, we propose that, in order to accommodate parallel processes involved in DSB repair and checkpoint signaling, DSB-associated ubiquitin structures must be nonuniform, using different linkages for distinct functional outputs. We highlight recent advances in the study of nondegradative ubiquitin signaling at DSBs, and discuss how recognition of different ubiquitin structures may influence DNA damage responses.},

By integrating copy number data with transcriptional profiles and performing pathway analysis in primary DLBCLs, we identified a comprehensive set of copy number alterations (CNAs) that decreased p53 activity and perturbed cell cycle regulation. Primary tumors either had multiple complementary alterations of p53 and cell cycle components or largely lacked these lesions. DLBCLs with p53 and cell cycle pathway CNAs had decreased abundance of p53 target transcripts and increased expression of E2F target genes and the Ki67 proliferation marker. CNAs of the CDKN2A-TP53-RB-E2F axis provide a structural basis for increased proliferation in DLBCL, predict outcome with current therapy, and suggest targeted treatment approaches.},

abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of plasma cells with complex molecular characteristics that evolves from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, a highly prevalent premalignant condition. MM is the second most frequent hematologic cancer in the United States, and it remains incurable, thereby highlighting the need for new therapeutic approaches, particularly those targeting common molecular pathways involved in disease progression and maintenance, shared across different MM subtypes. Here we report that Wnt/beta-catenin is one such pathway. We document the involvement of beta-catenin in cell-cycle regulation, proliferation, and invasion contributing to enhanced proliferative and metastatic properties of MM. The pleiotropic effects of beta-catenin in MM correlate with its transcriptional function, and we demonstrate regulation of a novel target gene, Aurora kinase A, implicating beta-catenin in G2/M regulation. beta-catenin and Aurora kinase A are present in most MM but not in normal plasma cells and are expressed in a pattern that parallels progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to MM. Our data provide evidence for a novel functional link between beta-catenin and Aurora kinase A, underscoring a critical role of these pathways in MM disease progression.},

The ultimate goal of this disease-oriented screen is to facilitate the discovery of new compounds with potential cell line-specific and/or subpanel-specific antitumor activity. In the current screening protocol, each cell line is inoculated onto microtiter plates, then preincubated for 24-28 hours. Subsequently, test agents are added in five 10-fold dilutions and the culture is incubated for an additional 48 hours. For each test agent, a dose-response profile is generated. End-point determinations of the cell viability or cell growth are performed by in situ fixation of cells, followed by staining with a protein-binding dye, sulforhodamine B (SRB). The SRB binds to the basic amino acids of cellular macromolecules; the solubilized stain is measured spectrophotometrically to determine relative cell growth or viability in treated and untreated cells. Following the pilot screening studies, a screening rate of 400 compounds per week has been consistently achieved.},

@article{Donoho2008a,
abstract = {In important application fields today-genomics and proteomics are examples-selecting a small subset of useful features is crucial for success of Linear Classification Analysis. We study feature selection by thresholding of feature Z-scores and introduce a principle of threshold selection, based on the notion of higher criticism (HC). For i = 1, 2, ..., p, let pi(i) denote the two-sided P-value associated with the ith feature Z-score and pi((i)) denote the ith order statistic of the collection of P-values. The HC threshold is the absolute Z-score corresponding to the P-value maximizing the HC objective (i/p - pi((i)))/sqrt\{i/p(1-i/p)\}. We consider a rare/weak (RW) feature model, where the fraction of useful features is small and the useful features are each too weak to be of much use on their own. HC thresholding (HCT) has interesting behavior in this setting, with an intimate link between maximizing the HC objective and minimizing the error rate of the designed classifier, and very different behavior from popular threshold selection procedures such as false discovery rate thresholding (FDRT). In the most challenging RW settings, HCT uses an unconventionally low threshold; this keeps the missed-feature detection rate under better control than FDRT and yields a classifier with improved misclassification performance. Replacing cross-validated threshold selection in the popular Shrunken Centroid classifier with the computationally less expensive and simpler HCT reduces the variance of the selected threshold and the error rate of the constructed classifier. Results on standard real datasets and in asymptotic theory confirm the advantages of HCT.},

Nineteen human breast cancer cell lines were tested for sensitivity to paclitaxel (T), 5-fluorouracil (F), doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) in vitro. Baseline gene expression data were obtained for each cell line with Affymetrix U133A gene chips, and multigene predictors of sensitivity were derived for each drug separately. These predictors were applied individually and in combination to human gene expression data generated with the same Affymetrix platform from fine needle aspiration specimens of 133 stage I-III breast cancers. Tumor samples were obtained at baseline, and each patient received 6 months of preoperative TFAC chemotherapy followed by surgery. Cell line-derived prediction results were correlated with the observed pathologic response to chemotherapy. Statistically robust differentially expressed genes between sensitive and resistant cells could only be found for paclitaxel. False discovery rates associated with the informative genes were high for all other drugs. For each drug, the top 100 differentially expressed genes were combined into a drug-specific response predictor. When these cell line-based predictors were applied to patient data, there was no significant correlation between observed response and predicted response either for individual drug predictors or combined predictions. Cell line-derived predictors of response to four commonly used chemotherapy drugs did not predict response accurately in patients.},

abstract = {Cancer subtype classification and survival prediction both relate directly to patients' specific treatment plans, making them fundamental medical issues. Although the two factors are interrelated learning problems, most studies tackle each separately. In this paper, expression levels of genes are used for both cancer subtype classification and survival prediction. We considered 350 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) subjects, taken from four groups of patients (activated B-cell-like subtype dead, activated B-cell-like subtype alive, germinal center B-cell-like subtype dead, and germinal center B-cell-like subtype alive). As classification features, we used 11,271 gene expression levels of each subject. The features were first ranked by mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) principle and further selected by IFS (Incremental Feature Selection) procedure. Thirty-five gene signatures were selected after the IFS procedure, and the patients were divided into the above mentioned four groups. These four groups were combined in different ways for subtype prediction and survival prediction, specifically, the activated versus the germinal center and the alive versus the dead. Subtype prediction accuracy of the 35-gene signature was 98.6\%. We calculated cumulative survival time of high-risk group and low-risk groups by the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test p-value was 5.98e-08. Our methodology provides a way to study subtype classification and survival prediction simultaneously. Our results suggest that for some diseases, especially cancer, subtype classification may be used to predict survival, and, conversely, survival prediction features may shed light on subtype features.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Several different multivariate prediction models using routine clinical variables or multigene signatures have been proposed to predict pathologic complete response to combination chemotherapy in breast cancer. Our goal was to compare the performance of four conceptually different predictors in an independent cohort of patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiling was done on fine-needle aspirations of 100 stage I to III breast cancers before preoperative paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide combination chemotherapy. Pathologic response was correlated with prediction results from a clinical nomogram, a human cancer-derived genomic predictor (DLDA30), a cell line-based genomic predictor [in vitro coexpression extrapolation (COXEN)], and an optimized cell line-derived (in vivo COXEN) predictor. None of the 100 test cases were used in the development of these predictors. RESULTS: The in vitro COXEN using a combination of four individual drug sensitivity predictions derived from cell lines was not predictive [area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), 0.5; 95\% confidence interval, (95\% CI), 0.41-0.59]. The clinical nomogram (AUC, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.65-0.80) and the DLDA30 (AUC, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.80) genomic predictor had similar performances. The in vivo COXEN that used informative genes from cell lines but was trained on a separate human data set also showed significant predictive value (AUC, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.60-0.74). These three different prediction scores correlated with each other and were significant in univariate but not in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Three conceptually different predictors performed similarly in this validation study and tended to identify the same patients as responders. A genomic predictor that relied solely on a composite of individual drug sensitivity predictions from cell lines did not show any predictive value.},

Our method of "nearest shrunken centroids" identifies subsets of genes that best characterize each class. The technique is general and can be used in many other classification problems.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study compared bortezomib with high-dose dexamethasone in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma who had received one to three previous therapies. METHODS: We randomly assigned 669 patients with relapsed myeloma to receive either an intravenous bolus of bortezomib (1.3 mg per square meter of body-surface area) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 for eight three-week cycles, followed by treatment on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for three five-week cycles, or high-dose dexamethasone (40 mg orally) on days 1 through 4, 9 through 12, and 17 through 20 for four five-week cycles, followed by treatment on days 1 through 4 for five four-week cycles. Patients who were assigned to receive dexamethasone were permitted to cross over to receive bortezomib in a companion study after disease progression. RESULTS: Patients treated with bortezomib had higher response rates, a longer time to progression (the primary end point), and a longer survival than patients treated with dexamethasone. The combined complete and partial response rates were 38 percent for bortezomib and 18 percent for dexamethasone (P<0.001), and the complete response rates were 6 percent and less than 1 percent, respectively (P<0.001). Median times to progression in the bortezomib and dexamethasone groups were 6.22 months (189 days) and 3.49 months (106 days), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.55; P<0.001). The one-year survival rate was 80 percent among patients taking bortezomib and 66 percent among patients taking dexamethasone (P=0.003), and the hazard ratio for overall survival with bortezomib was 0.57 (P=0.001). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were reported in 75 percent of patients treated with bortezomib and in 60 percent of those treated with dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS: Bortezomib is superior to high-dose dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have had a relapse after one to three previous therapies.},

abstract = {Gene expression profiling of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has revealed distinct molecular subtypes that include germinal center B cell-like (GCB) and activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. ABC DLBCL has a worse survival after upfront chemotherapy and is characterized by constitutive activation of the antiapoptotic nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway, which can inhibit chemotherapy. We hypothesized that inhibition of NF-kappaB might sensitize ABC but not GCB DLBCL to chemotherapy and improve outcome. As the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib can inhibit NF-kappaB through blocking IkappaBalpha degradation, we investigated bortezomib alone followed by bortezomib and doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in recurrent DLBCL. Tumor tissue was analyzed by gene expression profiling and/or immunohistochemistry to identify molecular DLBCL subtypes. As a control, we showed that relapsed/refractory ABC and GCB DLBCL have equally poor survivals after upfront chemotherapy. Bortezomib alone had no activity in DLBCL, but when combined with chemotherapy, it demonstrated a significantly higher response (83\% vs 13\%; P < .001) and median overall survival (10.8 vs 3.4 months; P = .003) in ABC compared with GCB DLBCL, respectively. These results suggest bortezomib enhances the activity of chemotherapy in ABC but not GCB DLBCL, and provide a rational therapeutic approach based on genetically distinct DLBCL subtypes.

Each signature was validated with response data from an independent set of cell line studies. We further show that many of these signatures can accurately predict clinical response in individuals treated with these drugs. Notably, signatures developed to predict response to individual agents, when combined, could also predict response to multidrug regimens. Finally, we integrated the chemotherapy response signatures with signatures of oncogenic pathway deregulation to identify new therapeutic strategies that make use of all available drugs. The development of gene expression profiles that can predict response to commonly used cytotoxic agents provides opportunities to better use these drugs, including using them in combination with existing targeted therapies.},

An inhibitor of IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta) targeting the classical NF-kappaB pathway was lethal to many myeloma cell lines. Several cell lines had elevated expression of NIK due to genomic alterations or protein stabilization, while others had inactivating mutations of TRAF3; both kinds of abnormality triggered the classical and alternative NF-kappaB pathways. A majority of primary myeloma patient samples and cell lines had elevated NF-kappaB target gene expression, often associated with genetic or epigenetic alteration of NIK, TRAF3, CYLD, BIRC2/BIRC3, CD40, NFKB1, or NFKB2. These data demonstrate that addiction to the NF-kappaB pathway is frequent in myeloma and suggest that IKKbeta inhibitors hold promise for the treatment of this disease.},

abstract = {ABCG2 was discovered in multi-drug-resistant cancer cells, with the identification of chemotherapeutic agents, such as mitoxantrone, flavopiridol, methotrexate and irinotecan as substrates. Later, drugs from other therapeutic groups were also described as substrates, including antibiotics, antivirals, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and flavonoids. An expanding list of compounds inhibiting ABCG2 has also been generated. The wide variety of drugs transported by ABCG2 and its normal tissue distribution with highest levels in the placenta, intestine and liver, suggest a role in protection against xenobiotics. ABCG2 also has an important role in the pharmacokinetics of its substrates. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the gene were shown to alter either plasma concentrations of substrate drugs or levels of resistance against chemotherapeutic agents in cell lines. ABCG2 was also described as the determinant of the side population of stem cells. All these aspects of the transporter warrant further research aimed at understanding ABCG2's structure, function and regulation of expression.},

We used this method to classify diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) biopsy samples into two gene expression subgroups based on data obtained from spotted cDNA microarrays. The germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subgroup expressed genes characteristic of normal germinal center B cells whereas the activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL subgroup expressed a subset of the genes that are characteristic of plasma cells, particularly those encoding endoplasmic reticulum and golgi proteins involved in secretion. We next used this predictor to discover these subgroups within a second set of DLBCL biopsies that had been profiled by using oligonucleotide microarrays [Shipp, M. A., et al. (2002) Nat. Med. 8, 68-74]. The GCB and ABC DLBCL subgroups identified in this data set had significantly different 5-yr survival rates after multiagent chemotherapy (62\% vs. 26\%; P < or = 0.0051), in accord with analyses of other DLBCL cohorts. These results demonstrate the ability of this gene expression-based predictor to classify DLBCLs into biologically and clinically distinct subgroups irrespective of the method used to measure gene expression.},

Recently, gene expression profiles (GEPs) of B-cell lymphomas based on microarray technologies have contributed significantly to improved sub-classification and diagnostics. However, the varying degrees of malignant B-cell frequencies in analysed samples influence the interpretation of the GEPs. Based on emerging next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) like tag sequencing (tag-seq) for GEP, it is expected that the detection of mRNA transcripts from malignant B-cells can be supplemented. This study provides a quantitative assessment and comparison of the ability of microarrays and tag-seq to detect mRNA transcripts from malignant B-cells. A model system was established by eight serial dilutions of the malignant B-cell lymphoma cell line, OCI-Ly8, into the embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293, prior to parallel analysis by exon microarrays and tag-seq.},

abstract = {We used cDNA microarrays to assess gene expression profiles in 60 human cancer cell lines used in a drug discovery screen by the National Cancer Institute. Using these data, we linked bioinformatics and chemoinformatics by correlating gene expression and drug activity patterns in the NCI60 lines. Clustering the cell lines on the basis of gene expression yielded relationships very different from those obtained by clustering the cell lines on the basis of their response to drugs. Gene-drug relationships for the clinical agents 5-fluorouracil and L-asparaginase exemplify how variations in the transcript levels of particular genes relate to mechanisms of drug sensitivity and resistance. This is the first study to integrate large databases on gene expression and molecular pharmacology.},

abstract = {The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has matured from a labour- and time-intensive, low throughput qualitative gel-based technique to an easily automated, rapid, high throughput quantitative technology. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) has become the benchmark technology for the detection and quantification of nucleic acids in a research, diagnostic, forensic and biotechnology setting. However, ill-assorted pre-assay conditions, poor assay design and inappropriate data analysis methodologies have resulted in the recurrent publication of data that are at best inconsistent and at worst irrelevant and even misleading. Furthermore, there is a lamentable lack of transparency of reporting, with the "Materials and Methods" sections of many publications, especially those with high impact factors, not fit for the purpose of evaluating the quality of any reported qPCR data. This poses a challenge to the integrity of the scientific literature, with serious consequences not just for basic research, but potentially calamitous implications for drug development and disease monitoring. These issues are being addressed by a set of guidelines that propose a minimum standard for the provision of information for qPCR experiments ("MIQE"). MIQE aims to restructure to-day's free-for-all qPCR methods into a more consistent format that will encourage detailed auditing of experimental detail, data analysis and reporting principles. General implementation of these guidelines is an important requisite for the maturing of qPCR into a robust, accurate and reliable nucleic acid quantification technology.},

abstract = {Real-time RT-PCR has been frequently used in quantitative research in molecular biology and bioinformatics. It provides remarkably useful technology to assess expression of genes. Although mathematical models for gene amplification process have been studied, statistical models and methods for data analysis in real-time RT-PCR have received little attention. In this paper, we briefly introduce current mathematical models, and study statistical models for real-time RT-PCR data. We propose a generalized estimation equations (GEE) model that properly reflects the structure of repeated data in RT-PCR experiments for both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. The GEE model takes the correlation between observations within the same subjects into consideration, and prevents from producing false positives or false negatives. We further demonstrate with a set of actual real-time RT-PCR data that different statistical models yield different estimations of fold change and confidence interval. The SAS program for data analysis using the GEE model is provided to facilitate easy computation for non-statistical professionals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), or R-CHOP, has significantly improved the survival of patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. Whether gene-expression signatures correlate with survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is unclear. METHODS: We profiled gene expression in pretreatment biopsy specimens from 181 patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma who received CHOP and 233 patients with this disease who received R-CHOP. A multivariate gene-expression-based survival-predictor model derived from a training group was tested in a validation group. RESULTS: A multivariate model created from three gene-expression signatures--termed "germinal-center B-cell," "stromal-1," and "stromal-2"--predicted survival both in patients who received CHOP and patients who received R-CHOP. The prognostically favorable stromal-1 signature reflected extracellular-matrix deposition and histiocytic infiltration. By contrast, the prognostically unfavorable stromal-2 signature reflected tumor blood-vessel density. CONCLUSIONS: Survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is influenced by differences in immune cells, fibrosis, and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment.},

abstract = {Compelling evidence suggests that inflammation, cell survival, and cancer are linked, with a central role played by NF-kappaB. Recent studies implicate some TLRs in tumor development based on their ability to facilitate tumor growth; however, to our knowledge, involvement of neither TLR7 nor TLR78 has yet been demonstrated. Here we have demonstrated expression of TLR7 and TLR8, the natural receptors for single-stranded RNA, by tumor cells in human lung cancer in situ and in human lung tumor cell lines. Stimulation with TLR7 or TLR8 agonists led to activated NF-kappaB, upregulated expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, increased tumor cell survival, and chemoresistance. Transcriptional analysis performed on human primary lung tumor cells and TLR7- or TLR8-stimulated human lung tumor cell lines revealed a gene expression signature suggestive of chronic stimulation of tumor cells by TLR ligands in situ. Together, these data emphasize that TLR signaling can directly favor tumor development and further suggest that researchers developing anticancer immunotherapy using TLR7 or TLR8 agonists as adjuvants should take into account the expression of these TLRs in lung tumor cells.},

@article{Bergsagel2005a,
abstract = {There appear to be two pathways involved in the pathogenesis of premalignant non-immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM). Nearly half of tumors are nonhyperdiploid, and mostly have one of five recurrent IgH translocations: 16\% 11q13 (CCN D1), 3\% 6p21 (CCN D3), 5\% 16q23 (MAF), 2\% 20q12 (MAFB), and 15\% 4p16 (FGFR3 and MMSET). The remaining hyperdiploid tumors have multiple trisomies involving chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19, and 21, and infrequently one of these five translocations. Although cyclin D1 is not expressed by healthy lymphoid cells, it is bi-allelically dysregulated in a majority of hyperdiploid tumors. Virtually all MM and MGUS tumors have dysregulated and/or increased expression of cyclin D1, D2, or D3, providing an apparent early, unifying event in pathogenesis. The patterns of translocations and cyclin D expression (TC) define a novel classification that includes eight groups: 11q; 6p; MAF; 4p; D1 (34\%); D1+D2 (6\%); D2 (17\%); and none (2\%). The hyperdiploid D1 group is virtually absent in extramedullary MM and MM cell lines, suggesting a particularly strong dependence on interaction with the bone marrow microenvironment. Despite shared progression events (RAS mutations, MYC dysregulation, p53 mutations, and additional disruption of the retinoblastoma pathway), the phenotypes of MGUS and MM tumors in the eight TC groups is determined mainly by early oncogenic events. Similar to acute lymphocytic leukemia, MM seems to include several diseases (groups) that have differences in early or initiating events, global gene expression patterns, bone marrow dependence, clinical features, prognosis, and response to therapy.},

The publication of studies with dissimilar or altogether contradictory results, obtained using different microarray platforms to analyze identical RNA samples, has raised concerns about the reliability of this technology. The MicroArray Quality Control (MAQC) project was initiated to address these concerns, as well as other performance and data analysis issues. Expression data on four titration pools from two distinct reference RNA samples were generated at multiple test sites using a variety of microarray-based and alternative technology platforms. Here we describe the experimental design and probe mapping efforts behind the MAQC project. We show intraplatform consistency across test sites as well as a high level of interplatform concordance in terms of genes identified as differentially expressed. This study provides a resource that represents an important first step toward establishing a framework for the use of microarrays in clinical and regulatory settings.},

Hierarchical clustering identified 10 distinct subgroups, of which six corresponded to clusters described in the UAMS classification, i.e. CD-1 (n=13, 4.1\%), CD-2 (n=34, 10.6\%), MF (n=32, 10.0\%), MS (n=33, 10.3\%), PR (n=15, 4.7\%), and HY (n=77, 24.1\%). Moreover, the UAMS LB cluster was identified as a subcluster of the MF cluster (n=15, 4.7\%). In addition, one subgroup (n=39, 12.2\%) showed a myeloid signature. Three novel subgroups were defined, including a subgroup of 37 patients (11.6\%) characterized by high expression of genes involved in the NFkappaB pathway, which include TNFAIP3 and CD40. Another subgroup of 22 patients (6.9\%) was characterized by distinct overexpression of cancer testis antigens without overexpression of proliferation genes. The third novel cluster of 9 patients (2.8\%) showed upregulation of protein tyrosine phosphatases PRL-3 and PTPRZ1 as well as SOCS3. To conclude, in addition to seven clusters described in the UAMS classification, we identified three novel subsets of MM, which may represent unique diagnostic entities.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that function by regulating target gene expression posttranscriptionally. They play a critical role in developmental and physiologic processes and are implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases including cancer. We examined the expression profiles of 241 human microRNAs in normal tissues and the NCI-60 panel of human tumor-derived cell lines. To quantify microRNA expression, we employed a highly sensitive technique that uses stem-loop primers for reverse transcription followed by real-time PCR. Most microRNAs were expressed at lower levels in tumor-derived cell lines compared with the corresponding normal tissue. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis of microRNA expression revealed four groups among the NCI-60 cell lines consisting of hematologic, colon, central nervous system, and melanoma tumor-derived cell lines clustered in a manner that reflected their tissue of origin. We identified specific subsets of microRNAs that provide candidate molecular signatures characteristic of the tumor-derived cell lines belonging to these four clusters. We also identified specific microRNA expression patterns that correlated with the proliferation indices of the NCI-60 cell lines, and we developed evidence for the identification of specific microRNAs as candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in different tumor types. Our results provide evidence that microRNA expression patterns may mark specific biological characteristics of tumors and/or mediate biological activities important for the pathobiology of malignant tumors. These findings call attention to the potential of microRNAs to provide etiologic insights as well as to serve as both diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for many different tumor types.},

SKY also identified the source of all the marker chromosomes. In addition, 10 chromosomes that were classified as normal by G-banding were found by SKY to be rearranged. CGH identified seven sites of high-level DNA amplification, 1q31-32, 2p12-16, 8q24, 11q23-25, 13q21-22, 13q32-34, and 18q21-23; of these, 1q31-32, 11q23-25, 13q21-22, and 13q32-34 have previously not been described as amplified in NHL. This comprehensive cytogenetic characterization of 10 NHL cell lines identified novel sites of rearrangement and amplification; it also enhances their value in experimental studies aimed at gene discovery and gene function.},

abstract = {BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor required for mature B-cell germinal center (GC) formation and implicated in lymphomagenesis. BCL6's physiologic function is only partially known because the complete set of its targets in GC B cells has not been identified. To address this issue, we used an integrated biochemical-computational-functional approach to identify BCL6 direct targets in normal GC B cells. This approach includes (1) identification of BCL6-bound promoters by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, (2) inference of transcriptional relationships by the use of a regulatory network reverse engineering approach (ARACNe), and (3) validation of physiologic relevance of the candidate targets down-regulated in GC B cells. Our approach demonstrated that a large set of promoters (> 4000) is physically bound by BCL6 but that only a fraction of them is repressed in GC B cells. This set of 1207 targets identifies several cellular functions directly controlled by BCL6 during GC development, including activation, survival, DNA-damage response, cell cycle arrest, cytokine signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, and differentiation. These results define a broad role of BCL6 in preventing centroblasts from responding to signals leading to exit from the GC before they complete the phase of proliferative expansion and of antibody affinity maturation.},

@article{Saha2010,
abstract = {Summary. Competing risks arise naturally in time-to-event studies. In this article, we propose time-dependent accuracy measures for a marker when we have censored survival times and competing risks. Time-dependent versions of sensitivity or true positive (TP) fraction naturally correspond to consideration of either cumulative (or prevalent) cases that accrue over a fixed time period, or alternatively to incident cases that are observed among event-free subjects at any select time. Time-dependent (dynamic) specificity (1-false positive (FP)) can be based on the marker distribution among event-free subjects. We extend these definitions to incorporate cause of failure for competing risks outcomes. The proposed estimation for cause-specific cumulative TP/dynamic FP is based on the nearest neighbor estimation of bivariate distribution function of the marker and the event time. On the other hand, incident TP/dynamic FP can be estimated using a possibly nonproportional hazards Cox model for the cause-specific hazards and riskset reweighting of the marker distribution. The proposed methods extend the time-dependent predictive accuracy measures of Heagerty, Lumley, and Pepe (2000, Biometrics 56, 337-344) and Heagerty and Zheng (2005, Biometrics 61, 92-105).},

@article{Ioannidis2007,
abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {To identify p53-target genes we have been using a cDNA-microarray system to assess gene expression in a p53-mutated glioblastoma cell line (U373MG) after adenovirus-mediated transfer of wild-type p53 into the p53-deficient cells. In the work reported here, expression of hCDC4b, which encodes one of the four subunits of the SCF (ubiquitin ligase) complex responsible for degradation of cyclin E, was dramatically up-regulated by infection with Ad-p53. An electrophoretic mobility-shift assay and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that a potential p53-binding site (p53BS) present in exon 1b of the hCDC4 gene was able to bind to p53, and a reporter assay confirmed that this p53BS had p53-dependent transcriptional activity. Expression of endogenous hCDC4b, but not the alternative transcript of this gene, hCDC4a, was induced in a p53-dependent manner in response to genotoxic stresses caused by UV irradiation and adriamycin treatment, suggesting that each transcript has a different functional role. These results suggest that hCDC4b is a previously unrecognized transcriptional target of the p53 protein, and that by negatively regulating cyclin E through induction of hCDC4b, p53 might stop cell-cycle progression at G0-G1. This would represent a novel mechanism for p53-dependent control of the cell cycle, in addition to the well-known p21(WAF1) machinery.},

@article{Yang2006b,
abstract = {We previously reported the identification of a new family of plant methyltransferases (MTs), named the SABATH family, that use S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to methylate a carboxyl moiety or a nitrogen-containing functional group on a diverse array of plant compounds. The Arabidopsis genome alone contains 24 distinct SABATH genes. To identify the catalytic specificities of members of this protein family in Arabidopsis, we screened recombinantly expressed and purified enzymes with a large number of potential substrates. Here,we report that the Arabidopsis thaliana gene At3g44860 encodes a protein with high catalytic specificity towards farnesoic acid (FA). Under steady-state conditions, this farnesoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (FAMT) exhibits KM values of 41 and 71 microM for FA and SAM, respectively. A three-dimensional model of FAMT constructed based upon similarity to the experimentally determined structure of Clarkia breweri salicylic acid methyltransferase (SAMT) suggests a reasonable model for FA recognition in the FAMT active site. In planta, the mRNA levels of At3g44860 increase in response to the exogenous addition of several compounds previously shown to induce plant defense responses at the transcriptional level. Although methyl farnesoate (MeFA) has not yet been detected in Arabidopsis, the presence of a FA-specific carboxyl methyltransferase in Arabidopsis capable of producing MeFA, an insect juvenile hormone made by some plants as a presumed defense against insect herbivory, suggests that MeFA or chemically similar compounds are likely to serve as new specialized metabolites in Arabidopsis.},

abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

Furthermore, we provide evidence that Wnt-5a also acts in vivo to promote beta-catenin degradation in regulating mammalian limb development and possibly in suppressing tumor formation.},

abstract = {The cell surface proteoglycan fraction isolated by mild trypsin treatment of NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells contains largely heparan sulfate, but also 15-24\% chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans. We conclude that this fraction contains a unique hybrid proteoglycan bearing both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans because (i) the proteoglycan behaves as a single species by sizing, ion exchange and collagen affinity chromatography, and by isopycnic centrifugation, even in the presence of 8 M urea or 4 M guanidine hydrochloride, (ii) the behavior of the chondroitin sulfate in these separation techniques is affected by heparan sulfate-specific probes and vice versa, and (iii) proteoglycan core protein bearing both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate is recognized by a single monoclonal antibody. Removal of both types of glycosaminoglycan reduces the proteoglycan to a core protein of approximately 53 kDa. The proteoglycan fraction is heterogeneous in size, largely due to a variable number and/or length of the glycosaminoglycan chains. We estimate that one or two chondroitin sulfate chains (modal Mr of 17,000) exist on the proteoglycan for every four heparan sulfate chains (modal Mr of 36,000). Synthesis of these chains is reportedly initiated on an identical trisaccharide that links the chains to the same amino acid residues on the core protein. Therefore, some regulatory information, perhaps residing in the amino acid sequence of the core protein, must determine the type of chain synthesized at any given linkage site. Post-translational addition of these glycosaminoglycans to the protein may provide information affecting its ultimate localization. It is likely that the protein is directed to specific sites on the cell surface because of the ability of the glycosaminoglycans to recognize and bind extracellular components.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The distinction between Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is unclear. We used transcriptional and genomic profiling to define Burkitt's lymphoma more precisely and to distinguish subgroups in other types of mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas. METHODS: We performed gene-expression profiling using Affymetrix U133A GeneChips with RNA from 220 mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas, including a core group of 8 Burkitt's lymphomas that met all World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. A molecular signature for Burkitt's lymphoma was generated, and chromosomal abnormalities were detected with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. RESULTS: We used the molecular signature for Burkitt's lymphoma to identify 44 cases: 11 had the morphologic features of diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas, 4 were unclassifiable mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas, and 29 had a classic or atypical Burkitt's morphologic appearance. Also, five did not have a detectable IG-myc Burkitt's translocation, whereas the others contained an IG-myc fusion, mostly in simple karyotypes. Of the 176 lymphomas without the molecular signature for Burkitt's lymphoma, 155 were diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas. Of these 155 cases, 21 percent had a chromosomal breakpoint at the myc locus associated with complex chromosomal changes and an unfavorable clinical course. CONCLUSIONS: Our molecular definition of Burkitt's lymphoma clarifies and extends the spectrum of the WHO criteria for Burkitt's lymphoma. In mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas without a gene signature for Burkitt's lymphoma, chromosomal breakpoints at the myc locus were associated with an adverse clinical outcome.},

One important model system for evaluating candidate anticancer agents is human tumour-derived cell lines. Although cultured cancer cells can exhibit distinct properties compared with their naturally growing counterparts, recent technologies that facilitate the parallel analysis of large panels of such lines, together with genomic technologies that define their genetic constitution, have revitalized efforts to use cancer cell lines to assess the clinical utility of new investigational cancer drugs and to discover predictive biomarkers.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that certain non-coding short RNAs, called miRNAs, play an important role in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma have great diversity in both clinical characteristics, site of presentation and outcome. The aim of our study is to validate the differential expression in germinal center and non-germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,s and to study to the extent to which the primary site of differentiation is associated with the miRNA expression profile. We studied 50 cases of de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma for the expression of 15 miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-17-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-92, miR-127, miR-155, miR-181a and miR-221). Apart from 19 nodal cases without extranodal dissemination (stages I and II), we selected two groups with unambiguous stages I and II extranodal presentation; 9 cases of primary central nervous system, 11 cases of primary testicular and 11 cases of other primary extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. All cases were analyzed with qRT-PCR. In situ hybridization for the most differentially expressed miRNAs was performed to show miRNA expression in tumor cells, but not in background cells. MiR-21 and miR-19b showed the highest expression levels. No significant differences were seen between germinal center and non-germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphomas in either the total or the nodal group for any of the 15 miRNAs. Two miRNAs showed significant differences in expression levels for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subgroups according to the site of presentation. MiR-17-5p showed a significant higher expression level in the central nervous system compared with testicular and nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (P<0.05). MiR-127 levels were significantly higher in testicular than in central nervous system and in nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (P<0.05). We conclude that the location of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is an important factor in determining the differential expression of miRNAs.},

abstract = {The mechanisms that regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate decisions between proliferation and multilineage differentiation are unclear. Members of the Wnt family of ligands that activate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which utilizes beta-catenin to relay the signal, have been demonstrated to regulate HSC function. In this study, we examined the role of noncanonical Wnt signaling in regulating HSC fate. We observed that noncanonical Wnt5a inhibited Wnt3a-mediated canonical Wnt signaling in HSCs and suppressed Wnt3a-mediated alterations in gene expression associated with HSC differentiation, such as increased expression of myc. Wnt5a increased short- and long-term HSC repopulation by maintaining HSCs in a quiescent G(0) state. From these data, we propose that Wnt5a regulates hematopoiesis by the antagonism of the canonical Wnt pathway, resulting in a pool of quiescent HSCs.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Chromosomal aberrations are a hallmark of multiple myeloma but their global prognostic impact is largely unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a genome-wide analysis of malignant plasma cells from 192 newly diagnosed patients with myeloma using high-density, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to identify genetic lesions associated with prognosis. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed deletions and amplifications in 98\% of patients. Amplifications in 1q and deletions in 1p, 12p, 14q, 16q, and 22q were the most frequent lesions associated with adverse prognosis, whereas recurrent amplifications of chromosomes 5, 9, 11, 15, and 19 conferred a favorable prognosis. Multivariate analysis retained three independent lesions: amp(1q23.3), amp(5q31.3), and del(12p13.31). When adjusted to the established prognostic variables (ie, t(4;14), del(17p), and serum beta(2)-microglobulin [Sbeta(2)M]), del(12p13.31) remained the most powerful independent adverse marker (P < .0001; hazard ratio [HR], 3.17) followed by Sbeta(2)M (P < .0001; HR, 2.78) and the favorable marker amp(5q31.3) (P = .0005; HR, 0.37). Patients with amp(5q31.3) alone and low Sbeta(2)M had an excellent prognosis (5-year overall survival, 87\%); conversely, patients with del(12p13.31) alone or amp(5q31.3) and del(12p13.31) and high Sbeta(2)M had a very poor outcome (5-year overall survival, 20\%). This prognostic model was validated in an independent validation cohort of 273 patients with myeloma. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the power and accessibility of molecular karyotyping to predict outcome in myeloma. In addition, integration of expression of genes residing in the lesions of interest revealed putative features of the disease driving short survival.},

abstract = {Profiling studies using microarrays to measure messenger RNA (mRNA) expression frequently identify long lists of differentially expressed genes. Differential expression is often validated using real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays. In conventional real-time RT-PCR assays, expression is normalized to a control, or housekeeping gene. However, no single housekeeping gene can be used for all studies. We used TaqMan Low-Density Arrays, a medium-throughput method for real-time RT-PCR using microfluidics to simultaneously assay the expression of 96 genes in nine samples of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We developed a novel statistical method, based on linear mixed-effects models, to analyze the data. This method automatically identifies the genes whose expression does not vary significantly over the samples, allowing them to be used to normalize the remaining genes. We compared the normalized real-time RT-PCR values with results obtained from Affymetrix Hu133A GeneChip oligonucleotide microarrays. We found that real-time RT-PCR using TaqMan Low-Density Arrays yielded reproducible measurements over seven orders of magnitude. Our model identified numerous genes that were expressed at nearly constant levels, including the housekeeping genes PGK1, GAPD, GUSB, TFRC, and 18S rRNA. After normalizing to the geometric mean of the unvarying genes, the correlation between real-time RT-PCR and microarrays was high for genes that were moderately expressed and varied across samples.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: To improve the understanding of molecular regulation events, various approaches have been developed for deducing gene regulatory networks from mRNA expression data. RESULTS: We present a new score for network inference, $\eta$(2), that is derived from an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Candidate transcription factor:target gene (TF:TG) relationships are assumed more likely if the expression of TF and TG are mutually dependent in at least a subset of the examined experiments. We evaluate this dependency by $\eta$(2), a non-parametric, non-linear correlation coefficient. It is fast, easy to apply and does not require the discretization of the input data. In the recent DREAM5 blind assessment, the arguably most comprehensive evaluation of inference methods, our approach based on $\eta$(2) was rated the best performer on real expression compendia. It also performs better than methods tested in other recently published comparative assessments. About half of our predicted novel predictions are true interactions as estimated from qPCR experiments performed for DREAM5.Conclusions: The score $\eta$(2) has a number of interesting features that enable the efficient detection of gene regulatory interactions. For most experimental setups, it is an interesting alternative to other measures of dependency such as Pearsons correlation or mutual information.

Conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization are routinely assessed in MM, and when combined with ISS stage may attain an even better predictive potential. In order to achieve even more effective and individualized therapies, one crucial goal is the identification of genes and gene combinations that predict for response or resistance to chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) still remains the standard therapy for younger patients, with novel agents now being included in both pre-transplant regimens and post-transplant consolidation/maintenance approaches. Similarly, novel agents are also being incorporated into allogeneic SCT for selected patients. In the treatment of elderly patients with MM, novel agents have been successfully incorporated into less intensive regimens, including melphalan/prednisone, low-dose dexamethasone, and cyclophosphamide/dexamethasone. While second-generation proteasome inhibitors are currently being intensively investigated, the subcutaneous administration of bortezomib, being equivalent to the established i.v. route, is now entering clinical practice. Supportive care remains a crucial aspect in the management of MM. The European Myeloma Network Trialist Group aims to address these contemporary aspects in MM.},

abstract = {Chromosome rearrangement, a hallmark of cancer, has profound effects on carcinogenesis and tumor phenotype. We used a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) as a model system to identify relationships among DNA copy number, mRNA expression level, and drug sensitivity. For each of 64 cancer-relevant genes, we calculated all 4,096 possible Pearson's correlation coefficients relating DNA copy number (assessed by comparative genomic hybridization using bacterial artificial chromosome microarrays) and mRNA expression level (determined using both cDNA and Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays). The analysis identified an association of ERBB2 overexpression with 3p copy number, a finding supported by data from human tumors and a mouse model of ERBB2-induced carcinogenesis. When we examined the correlation between DNA copy number for all 353 unique loci on the bacterial artificial chromosome microarray and drug sensitivity for 118 drugs with putatively known mechanisms of action, we found a striking negative correlation (-0.983; 95\% bootstrap confidence interval, -0.999 to -0.899) between activity of the enzyme drug L-asparaginase and DNA copy number of genes near asparagine synthetase in the ovarian cancer cells. Previous analysis of drug sensitivity and mRNA expression had suggested an inverse relationship between mRNA levels of asparagine synthetase and L-asparaginase sensitivity in the NCI-60. The concordance of pharmacogenomic findings at the DNA and mRNA levels strongly suggests further study of L-asparaginase for possible treatment of a low-synthetase subset of clinical ovarian cancers. The DNA copy number database presented here will enable other investigators to explore DNA transcript-drug relationships in their own domains of research focus.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To use European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry data to assess the benefit and optimal timing of a double-autologous transplantation strategy for patients with myeloma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 7,452 transplantation patients described as being either in a multiple graft program ("planned") or not, were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Subsequent multivariate analyses concentrated on the real occurrence of second transplantation, survival, relapse, and transplant-related mortality. RESULTS: Although the transplantation rate in the planned group failed to reach 60\%, the median survival from transplantation is 60 months for the planned, compared with 51 months for the remainder group. While the hazard ratio of the planned group is 0.89 (95\% CI, 0.79 to 1.00; P =.05) before approximately 70 months, this "effect" is reversed after 70 months, with the hazard ratio estimated as 3.01 (95\% CI, 1.07 to 8.46; P =.04). A time-dependent multivariate Cox analysis shows that, taking patients without a second transplantation as a reference group, those receiving a second transplantation in first remission (ie, before relapse) show an increased probability of transplant-related mortality, especially if the transplantation is performed more than 12 months after the first, and the reduction of the risk of relapse is less than when the transplantation is performed earlier. Performing a second transplantation after relapse does not seem to prolong survival, though a second transplantation before relapse is associated with a higher probability of mortality. CONCLUSION: To improve survival of tandem autologous transplantation in multiple myeloma, the second transplantation should preferably be performed before relapse and within 6 to 12 months of the first transplantation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-dose therapy with melphalan can prolong survival among patients with multiple myeloma. We assessed whether the addition of thalidomide, which has activity against advanced and refractory myeloma, would further improve survival. METHODS: Between October 1998 and February 2004, 668 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma received two cycles of intensive melphalan-based chemotherapy, each supported by autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. A total of 323 were randomly assigned to receive thalidomide from the outset until disease progression or undue adverse effects, and 345 did not receive thalidomide. The primary end point was the five-year event-free survival rate. Secondary end points were complete response and overall survival. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 42 months among survivors, the thalidomide and control groups had rates of complete response of 62 percent and 43 percent, respectively (P<0.001), and five-year event-free survival rates of 56 percent and 44 percent (P=0.01). The five-year rate of overall survival was approximately 65 percent in both groups (P=0.90). Median survival after relapse was 1.1 years in the thalidomide group and 2.7 years in the control group (P=0.001). Severe peripheral neuropathy and deep-vein thrombosis occurred more frequently in the thalidomide group than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: When incorporated into high-dose therapy for myeloma, thalidomide increased the frequency of complete responses and extended event-free survival at the expense of added adverse effects without improving overall survival.

Clusters of coexpressed genes identified through manipulations of mammary epithelial cells in vitro also showed consistent patterns of variation in expression among breast tumor samples. By using immunohistochemistry with antibodies against proteins encoded by a particular gene in a cluster, the identity of the cell type within the tumor specimen that contributed the observed gene expression pattern could be determined. Clusters of genes with coherent expression patterns in cultured cells and in the breast tumors samples could be related to specific features of biological variation among the samples. Two such clusters were found to have patterns that correlated with variation in cell proliferation rates and with activation of the IFN-regulated signal transduction pathway, respectively. Clusters of genes expressed by stromal cells and lymphocytes in the breast tumors also were identified in this analysis. These results support the feasibility and usefulness of this systematic approach to studying variation in gene expression patterns in human cancers as a means to dissect and classify solid tumors.},

abstract = {The capability of flow cytometry to offer rapid quantification of multidimensional characteristics for millions of cells has made this technology indispensable for health research, medical diagnosis, and treatment. However, the lack of statistical and bioinformatics tools to parallel recent high-throughput technological advancements has hindered this technology from reaching its full potential. We propose a flexible statistical model-based clustering approach for identifying cell populations in flow cytometry data based on t-mixture models with a Box-Cox transformation. This approach generalizes the popular Gaussian mixture models to account for outliers and allow for nonelliptical clusters. We describe an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to simultaneously handle parameter estimation and transformation selection. Using two publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed methodology provides enough flexibility and robustness to mimic manual gating results performed by an expert researcher. In addition, we present results from a simulation study, which show that this new clustering framework gives better results in terms of robustness to model misspecification and estimation of the number of clusters, compared to the popular mixture models. The proposed clustering methodology is well adapted to automated analysis of flow cytometry data. It tends to give more reproducible results, and helps reduce the significant subjectivity and human time cost encountered in manual gating analysis.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma are rapidly proliferating brain tumors in which hypoxia is readily recognizable, as indicated by focal or extensive necrosis and vascular proliferation, two independent diagnostic criteria for glioblastoma. Gene expression profiling of glioblastoma revealed a gene expression signature associated with hypoxia-regulated genes. The correlated gene set emerging from unsupervised analysis comprised known hypoxia-inducible genes involved in angiogenesis and inflammation such as VEGF and BIRC3, respectively. The relationship between hypoxia-modulated angiogenic genes and inflammatory genes was associated with outcome in our cohort of glioblastoma patients treated within prospective clinical trials of combined chemoradiotherapy. The hypoxia regulation of several new genes comprised in this cluster including ZNF395, TNFAIP3, and TREM1 was experimentally confirmed in glioma cell lines and primary monocytes exposed to hypoxia in vitro. Interestingly, the cluster seems to characterize differential response of tumor cells, stromal cells and the macrophage/microglia compartment to hypoxic conditions. Most genes classically associated with the inflammatory compartment are part of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway including TNFAIP3 and BIRC3 that have been shown to be involved in resistance to chemotherapy.Our results associate hypoxia-driven tumor response with inflammation in glioblastoma, hence underlining the importance of tumor-host interaction involving the inflammatory compartment.},

abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is clinically heterogeneous: 40\% of patients respond well to current therapy and have prolonged survival, whereas the remainder succumb to the disease. We proposed that this variability in natural history reflects unrecognized molecular heterogeneity in the tumours. Using DNA microarrays, we have conducted a systematic characterization of gene expression in B-cell malignancies. Here we show that there is diversity in gene expression among the tumours of DLBCL patients, apparently reflecting the variation in tumour proliferation rate, host response and differentiation state of the tumour. We identified two molecularly distinct forms of DLBCL which had gene expression patterns indicative of different stages of B-cell differentiation. One type expressed genes characteristic of germinal centre B cells ('germinal centre B-like DLBCL'); the second type expressed genes normally induced during in vitro activation of peripheral blood B cells ('activated B-like DLBCL'). Patients with germinal centre B-like DLBCL had a significantly better overall survival than those with activated B-like DLBCL. The molecular classification of tumours on the basis of gene expression can thus identify previously undetected and clinically significant subtypes of cancer.},

abstract = {A relatively high number of different subsets of B-cells are generated through the differentiation of early B-cell precursors into mature B-lymphocytes in the bone marrow (BM) and antigen-triggered maturation of germinal center B-cells into memory B-lymphocytes and plasmablasts in lymphoid tissues. These B-cell subpopulations, which are produced in the BM and lymphoid tissues, recirculate through peripheral blood (PB), into different tissues including mucosa and the BM, where long-living plasma cells produce antibodies. These circulating PB B-cells can be classified according to their maturation stage into i) immature/transitional, ii) na\"{\i}ve, and iii) memory B-lymphocytes, and iv) plasmablasts/plasma cells. Additionally, unique subsets of memory B-lymphocytes and plasmablasts/plasma cells can be identified based on their differential expression of unique Ig-heavy chain isotypes (e.g.: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA). In the present paper, we review recent data reported in the literature about the distribution, immunophenotypic and functional characteristics of these cell subpopulations, as well as their distribution in PB according to age and seasonal changes. Additional information is also provided in this regard based on the study of a population-based cohort of 600 healthy adults aged from 20 to 80 years, recruited in the Salamanca area in western Spain. Detailed knowledge of the distribution and traffic of B-cell subsets through PB mirrors the immune status of an individual subject and it may also contribute to a better understanding of B-cell disorders related to B-cell biology and homeostasis, such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL).},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To review the clinical pharmacology and clinical trials that have used intravenous (IV) high-dose melphalan (HDM). METHODS: We reviewed the mechanism of action, clinical pharmacology, and clinical studies of HDM with and without autologous bone marrow support (ABMT) or peripheral-blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) in the following disease areas: myeloma, ovarian cancer, malignant lymphoma, breast cancer, neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and acute leukemia. RESULTS: HDM has a distribution half-life (t1/2 alpha) of 5 to 15 minutes and an elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) of 17 to 75 minutes at doses of 140 to 180 mg/m2, with significant intrapatient variability. At these doses, a wide range of areas under the concentration/time curve (AUC) have been reported, ie, 146 to 1,515 mg/min/mL. HDM has significant clinical activity in patients with multiple myeloma in relapse or when used as consolidative therapy in relapsed ovarian cancer, relapsed Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, and relapsed neuroblastoma. Additional studies are required to determine the activity of HDM in Ewing's sarcoma or acute leukemia. Toxicities of HDM include myelosuppression, moderate nausea and vomiting, moderate to severe mucositis and diarrhea, and, infrequently, hepatic venoocclusive disease. CONCLUSION: HDM has become an established and effective salvage regimen for children with relapsed neuroblastoma, as well as an effective consolidative treatment for children with high-risk disease (stage IV). HDM is emerging as an active and effective mode of treatment in patients with stage II and III myeloma. The favorable toxicity profile of HDM and the availability of PBPCs allows for repetitive therapy.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Pre-existing and acquired drug resistance are major obstacles to the successful treatment of glioblastomas. METHODS: We used an integrated resistance model and genomics tools to globally explore molecular factors and cellular pathways mediating resistance to O6-alkylating agents in glioblastoma cells. RESULTS: We identified a transcriptomic signature that predicts a common in vitro and in vivo resistance phenotype to these agents, a proportion of which is imprinted recurrently by gene dosage changes in the resistant glioblastoma genome. This signature was highly enriched for genes with functions in cell death, compromise, and survival. Modularity was a predominant organizational principle of the signature, with functions being carried out by groups of interacting molecules in overlapping networks. A highly significant network was built around nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which included the persistent alterations of various NF-kappaB pathway elements. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) was identified as a new regulatory component of a putative cytoplasmic signaling cascade that mediates NF-kappaB activation in response to DNA damage caused by O6-alkylating agents. Expression of the corresponding zinc finger protein A20 closely mirrored the expression of the TNFAIP3 transcript, and was inversely related to NF-kappaB activation status in the resistant cells. A prediction model based on the resistance signature enabled the subclassification of an independent, validation cohort of 31 glioblastomas into two outcome groups (P = .037) and revealed TNFAIP3 as part of an optimized four-gene predictor associated significantly with patient survival (P = .022). CONCLUSION: Our results offer strong evidence for TNFAIP3 as a key regulator of the cytoplasmic signaling to activate NF-kappaB en route to O6-alkylating agent resistance in glioblastoma cells. This pathway may be an attractive target for therapeutic modulation of glioblastomas.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to establish a procedure capable of isolating distinct B-cell subpopulations from human tonsils as a basis for subsequent molecular analyses. Overall, 5 distinct B-cell subpopulations were purified from fresh tonsils based on their fluorescence surface marker expression: naive B cells, centroblasts, centrocytes, memory B cells, and plasmablasts. The immunophenotypic identity of the subpopulations was verified by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using the proliferation marker MKI-67 and 6 B-cell-associated differentiation markers (BACH2, BCL6, PAX5, IRF4, PRDM1, and XBP1). Furthermore, within the centroblast compartment, large and small centroblasts could be distinguished and large centroblasts were shown to proliferate with a morphologic appearance of a "centroblast"-like cell but with lower gene expression of the germinal center markers BCL6 and BACH2 vs small centroblasts. This study has established a detailed and fast procedure for simultaneous sorting of up to 5 distinct maturation-associated B-cell subpopulations from human tonsils.},

Here, we describe and validate an automated method for calculation of flow cytometric data from several multicolor stainings of the same cell sample--i.e., the merging of data from different aliquots stained with partially overlapping combinations of Mab reagents (focusing on > or =1 cell populations)--into one data file as if it concerned a single "super" multicolor staining. Evaluation of the performance of the method described was done in a group of 60 B-CLPD studied at diagnosis with 18 different reagents in a panel containing six different 3- and 4-color stainings, which systematically contained CD19 for the identification of B-cells. Our results show a high degree of correlation and agreement between originally measured and calculated data about cell surface stainings, providing a basis for the use of this approach for the generation of flow cytometric data files containing information about a virtually infinite number of stainings for each individual cellular event measured in a sample, using a limited number of fluorochrome stainings.},

Absolute quantification determines the input copy number, usually by relating the PCR signal to a standard curve. Relative quantification relates the PCR signal of the target transcript in a treatment group to that of another sample such as an untreated control. The 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method is a convenient way to analyze the relative changes in gene expression from real-time quantitative PCR experiments. The purpose of this report is to present the derivation, assumptions, and applications of the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method. In addition, we present the derivation and applications of two variations of the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method that may be useful in the analysis of real-time, quantitative PCR data.},

abstract = {To obtain a comprehensive genomic profile of presenting multiple myeloma cases we performed high resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping array analysis in 114 samples alongside 258 samples analysed by U133 Plus 2.0 expression array (Affymetrix). We examined DNA copy number alterations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in order to define the spectrum of minimally deleted regions in which relevant genes of interest can be found. The most frequent deletions are located at 1p (30\%), 6q (33\%), 8p (25\%), 12p (15\%), 13q (59\%), 14q (39\%), 16q (35\%), 17p (7\%), 20 (12\%) and 22 (18\%). In addition, copy number-neutral LOH, or uniparental disomy, was also prevalent on 1q (8\%), 16q (9\%), and X (20\%), and was associated with regions of gain and loss. Based on fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and expression quartile analysis, genes of prognostic importance were found to be located at 1p (FAF1, CDKN2C), 1q (ANP32E), and 17p (TP53). In addition, we identified common homozygously deleted genes which have functions relevant to myeloma biology. Taken together, these analyses indicate that the crucial pathways in myeloma pathogenesis include the NF-kappaB pathway, apoptosis, cell-cycle regulation, Wnt signalling and histone modifications. This study was registered at http://isrctn.org as ISRCTN68454111.},

abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To review the clinical pharmacology and clinical trials that have used intravenous (IV) high-dose melphalan (HDM). METHODS: We reviewed the mechanism of action, clinical pharmacology, and clinical studies of HDM with and without autologous bone marrow support (ABMT) or peripheral-blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) in the following disease areas: myeloma, ovarian cancer, malignant lymphoma, breast cancer, neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and acute leukemia. RESULTS: HDM has a distribution half-life (t1/2 alpha) of 5 to 15 minutes and an elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) of 17 to 75 minutes at doses of 140 to 180 mg/m2, with significant intrapatient variability. At these doses, a wide range of areas under the concentration/time curve (AUC) have been reported, ie, 146 to 1,515 mg/min/mL. HDM has significant clinical activity in patients with multiple myeloma in relapse or when used as consolidative therapy in relapsed ovarian cancer, relapsed Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, and relapsed neuroblastoma. Additional studies are required to determine the activity of HDM in Ewing's sarcoma or acute leukemia. Toxicities of HDM include myelosuppression, moderate nausea and vomiting, moderate to severe mucositis and diarrhea, and, infrequently, hepatic venoocclusive disease. CONCLUSION: HDM has become an established and effective salvage regimen for children with relapsed neuroblastoma, as well as an effective consolidative treatment for children with high-risk disease (stage IV). HDM is emerging as an active and effective mode of treatment in patients with stage II and III myeloma. The favorable toxicity profile of HDM and the availability of PBPCs allows for repetitive therapy.},

Each signature was validated with response data from an independent set of cell line studies. We further show that many of these signatures can accurately predict clinical response in individuals treated with these drugs. Notably, signatures developed to predict response to individual agents, when combined, could also predict response to multidrug regimens. Finally, we integrated the chemotherapy response signatures with signatures of oncogenic pathway deregulation to identify new therapeutic strategies that make use of all available drugs. The development of gene expression profiles that can predict response to commonly used cytotoxic agents provides opportunities to better use these drugs, including using them in combination with existing targeted therapies.},

abstract = {To better define the molecular basis of multiple myeloma (MM), we performed unsupervised hierarchic clustering of mRNA expression profiles in CD138-enriched plasma cells from 414 newly diagnosed patients who went on to receive high-dose therapy and tandem stem cell transplants. Seven disease subtypes were validated that were strongly influenced by known genetic lesions, such as c-MAF- and MAFB-, CCND1- and CCND3-, and MMSET-activating translocations and hyperdiploidy. Indicative of the deregulation of common pathways by gene orthologs, common gene signatures were observed in cases with c-MAF and MAFB activation and CCND1 and CCND3 activation, the latter consisting of 2 subgroups, one characterized by expression of the early B-cell markers CD20 and PAX5. A low incidence of focal bone disease distinguished one and increased expression of proliferation-associated genes of another novel subgroup. Comprising varying fractions of each of the other 6 subgroups, the proliferation subgroup dominated at relapse, suggesting that this signature is linked to disease progression. Proliferation and MMSET-spike groups were characterized by significant overexpression of genes mapping to chromosome 1q, and both exhibited a poor prognosis relative to the other groups. A subset of cases with a predominating myeloid gene expression signature, excluded from the profiling analyses, had more favorable baseline characteristics and superior prognosis to those lacking this signature.},

abstract = {The U.S. National Cancer Institute has used a panel of 60 diverse human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) to screen >100,000 chemical compounds for anticancer activity. However, not all important cancer types are included in the panel, nor are drug responses of the panel predictive of clinical efficacy in patients. We asked, therefore, whether it would be possible to extrapolate from that rich database (or analogous ones from other drug screens) to predict activity in cell types not included or, for that matter, clinical responses in patients with tumors. We address that challenge by developing and applying an algorithm we term "coexpression extrapolation" (COXEN). COXEN uses expression microarray data as a Rosetta Stone for translating from drug activities in the NCI-60 to drug activities in any other cell panel or set of clinical tumors. Here, we show that COXEN can accurately predict drug sensitivity of bladder cancer cell lines and clinical responses of breast cancer patients treated with commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, we used COXEN for in silico screening of 45,545 compounds and identify an agent with activity against human bladder cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As new therapeutic options for multiple myeloma (MM) emerge, identification of biological markers which could predict clinical response to standard treatment with high-dose melphalan (HDM) supported by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) becomes more important. DESIGN AND METHODS: Melphalan-induced damage formation and repair of monoadducts and interstrand cross-links in the p53 gene were studied in peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 32 patients prior to therapy. The same studies were performed in the peripheral blood cells of these patients immediately after subsequent HDM administration. Clinical response and time to progression were correlated with molecular endpoints obtained in vitro. RESULTS: Values for all molecular end-points examined in vitro were highly correlated with the respective in vivo results within individual patients. All in vitro end-points indicative of increased DNA damage and slower repair capacity were predictive of a favorable response to HDM; the area under the curve of total adducts (AUC-TA) had the highest predictive ability. Using the cut-off value of 736 adducts/10(6) nucleotides x h for the AUC-TA, the positive predictive value for clinical response to HDM was 100\%. Moreover, patients with an AUC-TA equal to or higher than this cut-off value had significantly longer times to progression than had patients with an AUC-TA lower than the cut-off value (hazard ratio 0.19; 95\% confidence intervals 0.06 to 0.60). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: An in vitro assay to quantify melphalan-induced p53-specific damage formation/repair can be used to select those patients with MM who are more likely to benefit from HDM supported by ASCT.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To use European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry data to assess the benefit and optimal timing of a double-autologous transplantation strategy for patients with myeloma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 7,452 transplantation patients described as being either in a multiple graft program ("planned") or not, were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Subsequent multivariate analyses concentrated on the real occurrence of second transplantation, survival, relapse, and transplant-related mortality. RESULTS: Although the transplantation rate in the planned group failed to reach 60\%, the median survival from transplantation is 60 months for the planned, compared with 51 months for the remainder group. While the hazard ratio of the planned group is 0.89 (95\% CI, 0.79 to 1.00; P =.05) before approximately 70 months, this "effect" is reversed after 70 months, with the hazard ratio estimated as 3.01 (95\% CI, 1.07 to 8.46; P =.04). A time-dependent multivariate Cox analysis shows that, taking patients without a second transplantation as a reference group, those receiving a second transplantation in first remission (ie, before relapse) show an increased probability of transplant-related mortality, especially if the transplantation is performed more than 12 months after the first, and the reduction of the risk of relapse is less than when the transplantation is performed earlier. Performing a second transplantation after relapse does not seem to prolong survival, though a second transplantation before relapse is associated with a higher probability of mortality. CONCLUSION: To improve survival of tandem autologous transplantation in multiple myeloma, the second transplantation should preferably be performed before relapse and within 6 to 12 months of the first transplantation.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to develop pharmacogenomic predictors in response to standard chemotherapy drugs in breast cancer cell lines and test their predictive value in patients who received treatment with the same drugs. Nineteen human breast cancer cell lines were tested for sensitivity to paclitaxel (T), 5-fluorouracil (F), doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) in vitro. Baseline gene expression data were obtained for each cell line with Affymetrix U133A gene chips, and multigene predictors of sensitivity were derived for each drug separately. These predictors were applied individually and in combination to human gene expression data generated with the same Affymetrix platform from fine needle aspiration specimens of 133 stage I-III breast cancers. Tumor samples were obtained at baseline, and each patient received 6 months of preoperative TFAC chemotherapy followed by surgery. Cell line-derived prediction results were correlated with the observed pathologic response to chemotherapy. Statistically robust differentially expressed genes between sensitive and resistant cells could only be found for paclitaxel. False discovery rates associated with the informative genes were high for all other drugs. For each drug, the top 100 differentially expressed genes were combined into a drug-specific response predictor. When these cell line-based predictors were applied to patient data, there was no significant correlation between observed response and predicted response either for individual drug predictors or combined predictions. Cell line-derived predictors of response to four commonly used chemotherapy drugs did not predict response accurately in patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM) comprise heterogeneous disorders with incompletely understood molecular defects and variable clinical features. We performed gene expression profiling (GEP) with microarray data to better dissect the molecular phenotypes, sensitivity to particular chemotherapeutic agents, and prognoses of these diseases. METHODS: Using gene expression and clinical data from 877 patients ranging from normal plasma cells (NPC) to relapsed MM (RMM), we applied gene expression signatures reflecting deregulation of oncogenic pathways and tumor microenvironment to highlight molecular changes that occur as NPCs transition to MM, create a high-risk MGUS gene signature, and subgroup International Staging System (ISS) stages into more prognostically accurate clusters of patients. Lastly, we used gene signatures to predict sensitivity to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies among identified clusters of patients. RESULTS: Myc upregulation and increasing chromosomal instability (CIN) characterized the evolution from NPC to RMM (P < .0001 for both). Studies of MGUS revealed that some samples shared biologic features with RMM, which comprised the basis for a high-risk MGUS signature. Regarding MM, we subclassified ISS stages into clusters based on shared features of tumor biology. These clusters differentiated themselves based on predictions for prognosis and chemotherapy sensitivity (eg, in ISS stage I, one cluster was characterized by increased CIN, cyclophosphamide resistance, and a poor prognosis). CONCLUSION: GEP provides insight into the molecular defects underlying plasma cell dyscrasias that may explain their clinical heterogeneity. GEP also may also refine current prognostic and therapeutic models for MGUS and MM.},

abstract = {Most cancer treatments benefit only a minority of patients. This has led to a widespread interest in the identification of gene-expression-based prognostic signatures. Well-developed and validated genomic signatures can lead to personalized treatment decisions resulting in improved patient management. However, the pace of acceptance of these signatures in clinical practice has been slow. This is because many of the signatures have been developed without clear focus on the intended clinical use, and proper independent validation studies establishing their medical utility have rarely been performed. The practicing physician and the patient are thus left in doubt about the reliability and medical utility of the signatures. We aim to provide guidance to physicians in critically evaluating published studies on prognostic gene-expression signatures so that they are better equipped to decide which signatures, if any, have sufficient merit for use, in conjunction with other factors in helping their patients to make good treatment decisions. A discussion of the lessons to be learned from the successful development of the Oncotype DX((R)) genetic test for breast cancer is presented and contrasted with a review of the current status of prognostic gene-expression signatures in non-small-cell lung cancer.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that function by regulating target gene expression posttranscriptionally. They play a critical role in developmental and physiologic processes and are implicated in the pathogenesis of several human diseases including cancer. We examined the expression profiles of 241 human microRNAs in normal tissues and the NCI-60 panel of human tumor-derived cell lines. To quantify microRNA expression, we employed a highly sensitive technique that uses stem-loop primers for reverse transcription followed by real-time PCR. Most microRNAs were expressed at lower levels in tumor-derived cell lines compared with the corresponding normal tissue. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis of microRNA expression revealed four groups among the NCI-60 cell lines consisting of hematologic, colon, central nervous system, and melanoma tumor-derived cell lines clustered in a manner that reflected their tissue of origin. We identified specific subsets of microRNAs that provide candidate molecular signatures characteristic of the tumor-derived cell lines belonging to these four clusters. We also identified specific microRNA expression patterns that correlated with the proliferation indices of the NCI-60 cell lines, and we developed evidence for the identification of specific microRNAs as candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in different tumor types. Our results provide evidence that microRNA expression patterns may mark specific biological characteristics of tumors and/or mediate biological activities important for the pathobiology of malignant tumors. These findings call attention to the potential of microRNAs to provide etiologic insights as well as to serve as both diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for many different tumor types.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B-cell malignancy characterized by a variable clinical course. Several parameters have prognostic capabilities but are associated with altered response to therapy in only a small subset of patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used gene expression profiling methods to generate predictors of therapy response and prognosis. Genomic signatures that reflect progressive disease and responses to chemotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy were created using cancer cell lines and patient leukemia cell samples. We validated and applied these three signatures to independent clinical data from four cohorts, representing a total of 301 CLL patients. RESULTS: A genomic signature of prognosis created from patient leukemic cell gene expression data coupled with clinical parameters significantly differentiated patients with stable disease from those with progressive disease in the training data set. The progression signature was validated in two independent data sets, showing a capacity to accurately identify patients at risk for progressive disease. In addition, genomic signatures that predict response to chlorambucil or pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab were generated and could accurately distinguish responding and nonresponding CLL patients. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, microarray analysis of CLL lymphocytes can be used to refine prognosis and predict response to different therapies. These results have implications for standard and investigational therapeutics in CLL patients.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to develop pharmacogenomic predictors in response to standard chemotherapy drugs in breast cancer cell lines and test their predictive value in patients who received treatment with the same drugs. Nineteen human breast cancer cell lines were tested for sensitivity to paclitaxel (T), 5-fluorouracil (F), doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) in vitro. Baseline gene expression data were obtained for each cell line with Affymetrix U133A gene chips, and multigene predictors of sensitivity were derived for each drug separately. These predictors were applied individually and in combination to human gene expression data generated with the same Affymetrix platform from fine needle aspiration specimens of 133 stage I-III breast cancers. Tumor samples were obtained at baseline, and each patient received 6 months of preoperative TFAC chemotherapy followed by surgery. Cell line-derived prediction results were correlated with the observed pathologic response to chemotherapy. Statistically robust differentially expressed genes between sensitive and resistant cells could only be found for paclitaxel. False discovery rates associated with the informative genes were high for all other drugs. For each drug, the top 100 differentially expressed genes were combined into a drug-specific response predictor. When these cell line-based predictors were applied to patient data, there was no significant correlation between observed response and predicted response either for individual drug predictors or combined predictions. Cell line-derived predictors of response to four commonly used chemotherapy drugs did not predict response accurately in patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Pre-existing and acquired drug resistance are major obstacles to the successful treatment of glioblastomas. METHODS: We used an integrated resistance model and genomics tools to globally explore molecular factors and cellular pathways mediating resistance to O6-alkylating agents in glioblastoma cells. RESULTS: We identified a transcriptomic signature that predicts a common in vitro and in vivo resistance phenotype to these agents, a proportion of which is imprinted recurrently by gene dosage changes in the resistant glioblastoma genome. This signature was highly enriched for genes with functions in cell death, compromise, and survival. Modularity was a predominant organizational principle of the signature, with functions being carried out by groups of interacting molecules in overlapping networks. A highly significant network was built around nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), which included the persistent alterations of various NF-kappaB pathway elements. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3) was identified as a new regulatory component of a putative cytoplasmic signaling cascade that mediates NF-kappaB activation in response to DNA damage caused by O6-alkylating agents. Expression of the corresponding zinc finger protein A20 closely mirrored the expression of the TNFAIP3 transcript, and was inversely related to NF-kappaB activation status in the resistant cells. A prediction model based on the resistance signature enabled the subclassification of an independent, validation cohort of 31 glioblastomas into two outcome groups (P = .037) and revealed TNFAIP3 as part of an optimized four-gene predictor associated significantly with patient survival (P = .022). CONCLUSION: Our results offer strong evidence for TNFAIP3 as a key regulator of the cytoplasmic signaling to activate NF-kappaB en route to O6-alkylating agent resistance in glioblastoma cells. This pathway may be an attractive target for therapeutic modulation of glioblastomas.},

abstract = {Chromosome rearrangement, a hallmark of cancer, has profound effects on carcinogenesis and tumor phenotype. We used a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) as a model system to identify relationships among DNA copy number, mRNA expression level, and drug sensitivity. For each of 64 cancer-relevant genes, we calculated all 4,096 possible Pearson's correlation coefficients relating DNA copy number (assessed by comparative genomic hybridization using bacterial artificial chromosome microarrays) and mRNA expression level (determined using both cDNA and Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays). The analysis identified an association of ERBB2 overexpression with 3p copy number, a finding supported by data from human tumors and a mouse model of ERBB2-induced carcinogenesis. When we examined the correlation between DNA copy number for all 353 unique loci on the bacterial artificial chromosome microarray and drug sensitivity for 118 drugs with putatively known mechanisms of action, we found a striking negative correlation (-0.983; 95\% bootstrap confidence interval, -0.999 to -0.899) between activity of the enzyme drug L-asparaginase and DNA copy number of genes near asparagine synthetase in the ovarian cancer cells. Previous analysis of drug sensitivity and mRNA expression had suggested an inverse relationship between mRNA levels of asparagine synthetase and L-asparaginase sensitivity in the NCI-60. The concordance of pharmacogenomic findings at the DNA and mRNA levels strongly suggests further study of L-asparaginase for possible treatment of a low-synthetase subset of clinical ovarian cancers. The DNA copy number database presented here will enable other investigators to explore DNA transcript-drug relationships in their own domains of research focus.},

We further show that many of these signatures can accurately predict clinical response in individuals treated with these drugs. Notably, signatures developed to predict response to individual agents, when combined, could also predict response to multidrug regimens. Finally, we integrated the chemotherapy response signatures with signatures of oncogenic pathway deregulation to identify new therapeutic strategies that make use of all available drugs. The development of gene expression profiles that can predict response to commonly used cytotoxic agents provides opportunities to better use these drugs, including using them in combination with existing targeted therapies.},

The problem is exacerbated by a lack of sufficient experimental detail in many publications, which impedes a reader's ability to evaluate critically the quality of the results presented or to repeat the experiments. CONTENT: The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines target the reliability of results to help ensure the integrity of the scientific literature, promote consistency between laboratories, and increase experimental transparency. MIQE is a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating qPCR experiments. Included is a checklist to accompany the initial submission of a manuscript to the publisher. By providing all relevant experimental conditions and assay characteristics, reviewers can assess the validity of the protocols used. Full disclosure of all reagents, sequences, and analysis methods is necessary to enable other investigators to reproduce results. MIQE details should be published either in abbreviated form or as an online supplement. SUMMARY: Following these guidelines will encourage better experimental practice, allowing more reliable and unequivocal interpretation of qPCR results.},

Heart transplantation is the most effective therapy, but the number of eligible patients far outweighs the number of available donor hearts. The left mechanical ventricular assist device (LVAD) has been developed as a successful substitution therapy that aids the failing ventricle while a patient is waiting for the donor heart. We obtained genomics data from paired human heart samples harvested at the time of LVAD implant and explant. The heart failure patients in our study were supported by the LVAD for various periods of time. The goal of this study is to model the relationship between the time of LVAD support and gene expression changes. RESULTS: To serve the purpose, we propose a novel penalized partial least squares (PPLS) method to build a regression model. Compared with partial least squares and Breiman's random forest method, PPLS gives the best prediction results for the LVAD data.},

abstract = {The choice of therapy for metastatic cancer is largely empirical because of a lack of chemosensitivity prediction for available combination chemotherapeutic regimens. Here, we identify molecular models of bladder carcinoma chemosensitivity based on gene expression for three widely used chemotherapeutic agents: cisplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine. We measured the growth inhibition elicited by these three agents in a series of 40 human urothelial cancer cell lines and correlated the GI(50) (50\% of growth inhibition) values with quantitative measures of global gene expression to derive models of chemosensitivity using a misclassification-penalized posterior approach. The misclassification-penalized posterior-derived models predicted the growth response of human bladder cancer cell lines to each of the three agents with sensitivities of between 0.93 and 0.96. We then developed an in silico approach to predict the cellular growth responses for each of these agents in the clinically relevant two-agent combinations. These predictions were prospectively evaluated on a series of 15 randomly chosen bladder carcinoma cell lines. Overall, 80\% of the predicted combinations were correct (P = 0.0002). Together, our results suggest that chemosensitivity to drug combinations can be predicted based on molecular models and provide the framework for evaluation of such models in patients undergoing combination chemotherapy for cancer. If validated in vivo, such predictive models have the potential to guide therapeutic choice at the level of an individual's tumor.},

The purpose of this report is to present the derivation, assumptions, and applications of the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method.

abstract = {Classification using high-dimensional features arises frequently in many contemporary statistical studies such as tumor classification using microarray or other high-throughput data. The impact of dimensionality on classifications is largely poorly understood. In a seminal paper, Bickel and Levina (2004) show that the Fisher discriminant performs poorly due to diverging spectra and they propose to use the independence rule to overcome the problem. We first demonstrate that even for the independence classification rule, classification using all the features can be as bad as the random guessing due to noise accumulation in estimating population centroids in high-dimensional feature space. In fact, we demonstrate further that almost all linear discriminants can perform as bad as the random guessing. Thus, it is paramountly important to select a subset of important features for high-dimensional classification, resulting in Features Annealed Independence Rules (FAIR). The conditions under which all the important features can be selected by the two-sample t-statistic are established. The choice of the optimal number of features, or equivalently, the threshold value of the test statistics are proposed based on an upper bound of the classification error. Simulation studies and real data analysis support our theoretical results and demonstrate convincingly the advantage of our new classification procedure.},

Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma have great diversity in both clinical characteristics, site of presentation and outcome. The aim of our study is to validate the differential expression in germinal center and non-germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,s and to study to the extent to which the primary site of differentiation is associated with the miRNA expression profile. We studied 50 cases of de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphoma for the expression of 15 miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-15b, miR-16, miR-17-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-18a, miR-19a, miR-19b, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-92, miR-127, miR-155, miR-181a and miR-221). Apart from 19 nodal cases without extranodal dissemination (stages I and II), we selected two groups with unambiguous stages I and II extranodal presentation; 9 cases of primary central nervous system, 11 cases of primary testicular and 11 cases of other primary extranodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. All cases were analyzed with qRT-PCR. In situ hybridization for the most differentially expressed miRNAs was performed to show miRNA expression in tumor cells, but not in background cells. MiR-21 and miR-19b showed the highest expression levels. No significant differences were seen between germinal center and non-germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphomas in either the total or the nodal group for any of the 15 miRNAs. Two miRNAs showed significant differences in expression levels for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma subgroups according to the site of presentation. MiR-17-5p showed a significant higher expression level in the central nervous system compared with testicular and nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (P<0.05). MiR-127 levels were significantly higher in testicular than in central nervous system and in nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (P<0.05). We conclude that the location of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is an important factor in determining the differential expression of miRNAs.},

abstract = {Accurate normalization is an absolute prerequisite for correct measurement of gene expression. For quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), the most commonly used normalization strategy involves standardization to a single constitutively expressed control gene. However, in recent years, it has become clear that no single gene is constitutively expressed in all cell types and under all experimental conditions, implying that the expression stability of the intended control gene has to be verified before each experiment. We outline a novel, innovative, and robust strategy to identify stably expressed genes among a set of candidate normalization genes. The strategy is rooted in a mathematical model of gene expression that enables estimation not only of the overall variation of the candidate normalization genes but also of the variation between sample subgroups of the sample set. Notably, the strategy provides a direct measure for the estimated expression variation, enabling the user to evaluate the systematic error introduced when using the gene. In a side-by-side comparison with a previously published strategy, our model-based approach performed in a more robust manner and showed less sensitivity toward coregulation of the candidate normalization genes. We used the model-based strategy to identify genes suited to normalize quantitative RT-PCR data from colon cancer and bladder cancer. These genes are UBC, GAPD, and TPT1 for the colon and HSPCB, TEGT, and ATP5B for the bladder. The presented strategy can be applied to evaluate the suitability of any normalization gene candidate in any kind of experimental design and should allow more reliable normalization of RT-PCR data.},

abstract = {The TRE17 (USP6/TRE-2) oncogene induces tumorigenesis in both humans and mice. However, little is known regarding its regulation or mechanism of transformation. TRE17 encodes a TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16)/Rab GTPase-activating protein homology domain at its N terminus and a ubiquitin-specific protease at its C terminus. In the current study, we identified the ubiquitous calcium (Ca2+)-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) as a novel binding partner for TRE17. CaM bound directly to TRE17 in a Ca2+-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. The CaM-binding site was mapped to two hydrophobic motifs near the C terminus of the TBC domain. Point mutations within these motifs significantly reduced the interaction of TRE17 with CaM. We further found that TRE17 is monoubiquitinated and promotes its own deubiquitination in vivo. CaM binding-deficient mutants of TRE17 exhibited significantly reduced monoubiquitination, suggesting that binding of Ca2+/CaM to TRE17 promotes this modification. Consistent with this notion, treatment of cells with the CaM inhibitor W7 reduced levels of TRE17 monoubiquitination. Interestingly, the calcium ionophore A23187 induced accumulation of a polyubiquitinated TRE17 species. The effect of A23187 was attenuated in CaM binding-deficient mutants of TRE17. Taken together, these studies indicate a role for Ca2+/CaM in regulating ubiquitination through direct interaction with TRE17.},

abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), or R-CHOP, has significantly improved the survival of patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. Whether gene-expression signatures correlate with survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is unclear. METHODS: We profiled gene expression in pretreatment biopsy specimens from 181 patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma who received CHOP and 233 patients with this disease who received R-CHOP. A multivariate gene-expression-based survival-predictor model derived from a training group was tested in a validation group. RESULTS: A multivariate model created from three gene-expression signatures--termed "germinal-center B-cell," "stromal-1," and "stromal-2"--predicted survival both in patients who received CHOP and patients who received R-CHOP. The prognostically favorable stromal-1 signature reflected extracellular-matrix deposition and histiocytic infiltration. By contrast, the prognostically unfavorable stromal-2 signature reflected tumor blood-vessel density. CONCLUSIONS: Survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is influenced by differences in immune cells, fibrosis, and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment.},

The ultimate goal of this disease-oriented screen is to facilitate the discovery of new compounds with potential cell line-specific and/or subpanel-specific antitumor activity. In the current screening protocol, each cell line is inoculated onto microtiter plates, then preincubated for 24-28 hours. Subsequently, test agents are added in five 10-fold dilutions and the culture is incubated for an additional 48 hours. For each test agent, a dose-response profile is generated. End-point determinations of the cell viability or cell growth are performed by in situ fixation of cells, followed by staining with a protein-binding dye, sulforhodamine B (SRB). The SRB binds to the basic amino acids of cellular macromolecules; the solubilized stain is measured spectrophotometrically to determine relative cell growth or viability in treated and untreated cells. Following the pilot screening studies, a screening rate of 400 compounds per week has been consistently achieved.},

SKY also identified the source of all the marker chromosomes. In addition, 10 chromosomes that were classified as normal by G-banding were found by SKY to be rearranged.

The full-length complementary DNA was obtained by a method of 5'-rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends. The predicted open reading frame encodes a typical type II membrane protein comprising 543 amino acids, the sequence of which was highly homologous to chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (CSGalNAcT-1), and we designated this novel enzyme CSGalNAcT-2. CSGalNAcT-2 showed much stronger N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity toward glucuronic acid of chondroitin poly- and oligosaccharides, and chondroitin sulfate poly- and oligosaccharides with a beta 1-4 linkage, i.e. elongation activity for chondroitin and chondroitin sulfate, but showed much weaker activity toward a tetrasaccharide of the glycosaminoglycan linkage structure (GlcA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-O-methoxyphenyl), i.e. initiation activity, than CSGalNAcT-1. Transfection of the CSGalNAcT-1 gene into Chinese hamster ovary cells yielded a change of glycosaminoglycan composition, i.e. the replacement of heparan sulfate on a syndecan-4/fibroblast growth factor-1 chimera protein by chondroitin sulfate, however, transfection of the CSGalNAcT-2 gene did not. The above results indicated that CSGalNAcT-1 is involved in the initiation of chondroitin sulfate synthesis, whereas CSGalNAcT-2 participates mainly in the elongation, not initiation. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that CSGalNAcT-2 transcripts were highly expressed in the small intestine, leukocytes, and spleen, however, both CSGalNAcTs were ubiquitously expressed in various tissues.},

In tandem, gene expression profiling has brought about a sea change in our understanding of cancer biology, allowing discovery of biomarkers or signatures able to characterize, classify, and prognosticate clinical behavior of human tumors. Recent studies have used tumor profiling matched to clinical trial outcome data to derive gene expression models predicting therapeutic outcomes, though such efforts are costly, time-consuming, tumor type-specific, and not amenable to rare diseases. Furthermore, addition of new or established drugs to multidrug combinations in which such models are already available requires the entire model to be re-derived. Can the aforementioned in vitro testing platform, coupled to the universal language of genomics, be used to develop, a priori, gene expression models predictive of clinical outcomes? Recent advances, including the CO-eXpression ExtrapolatioN (COXEN) algorithm, suggest that development of these models may be possible and raise important implications for future trial design and drug discovery.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Survival of patients with multiple myeloma is highly heterogeneous, from periods of a few weeks to more than 10 years. We used gene expression profiles of myeloma cells obtained at diagnosis to identify broadly applicable prognostic markers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a training set of 182 patients, we used supervised methods to identify individual genes associated with length of survival. A survival model was built from these genes. The validity of our model was assessed in our test set of 68 patients and in three independent cohorts comprising 853 patients with multiple myeloma. RESULTS: The 15 strongest genes associated with the length of survival were used to calculate a risk score and to stratify patients into low-risk and high-risk groups. The survival-predictor score was significantly associated with survival in both the training and test sets and in the external validation cohorts. The Kaplan-Meier estimates of rates of survival at 3 years were 90.5\% (95\% CI, 85.6\% to 95.3\%) and 47.4\% (95\% CI, 33.5\% to 60.1\%), respectively, in our patients having a low risk or high risk independently of traditional prognostic factors. High-risk patients constituted a homogeneous biologic entity characterized by the overexpression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and its surveillance, whereas low-risk patients were heterogeneous and displayed hyperdiploid signatures. CONCLUSION: Gene expression-based survival prediction and molecular features associated with high-risk patients may be useful for developing prognostic markers and may provide basis to treat these patients with new targeted antimitotics.},

abstract = {The Fanconi anemia/BRCA (FA/BRCA) DNA damage repair pathway plays a pivotal role in the cellular response to replicative stress induced by DNA alkylating agents and greatly influences drug response in cancer treatment. We recently reported that FA/BRCA genes are overexpressed and causative for drug resistance in human melphalan-resistant multiple myeloma cell lines. However, the transcriptional regulation of the FA/BRCA pathway is not understood. In this report, we describe for the first time a novel function of the NF-kappaB subunits, RelB/p50, as transcriptional activators of the FA/BRCA pathway. Specifically, our findings point to constitutive phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase alpha and subsequent alterations in FANCD2 expression and function as underlying events leading to melphalan resistance in repeatedly exposed multiple myeloma cells. Inhibiting NF-kappaB by small interfering RNA, blocking the IkappaB kinase complex with BMS-345541, or using the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib drastically reduced FA/BRCA gene expression and FANCD2 protein expression in myeloma cells, resulting in diminished DNA damage repair and enhanced melphalan sensitivity. Importantly, we also found that bortezomib decreases FA/BRCA gene expression in multiple myeloma patients. These results show for the first time that NF-kappaB transcriptionally regulates the FA/BRCA pathway and provide evidence for targeting Fanconi anemia-mediated DNA repair to enhance chemotherapeutic response and circumvent drug resistance in myeloma patients.},

abstract = {The mechanisms that regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate decisions between proliferation and multilineage differentiation are unclear. Members of the Wnt family of ligands that activate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which utilizes beta-catenin to relay the signal, have been demonstrated to regulate HSC function. In this study, we examined the role of noncanonical Wnt signaling in regulating HSC fate. We observed that noncanonical Wnt5a inhibited Wnt3a-mediated canonical Wnt signaling in HSCs and suppressed Wnt3a-mediated alterations in gene expression associated with HSC differentiation, such as increased expression of myc. Wnt5a increased short- and long-term HSC repopulation by maintaining HSCs in a quiescent G(0) state. From these data, we propose that Wnt5a regulates hematopoiesis by the antagonism of the canonical Wnt pathway, resulting in a pool of quiescent HSCs.},

abstract = {The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has matured from a labour- and time-intensive, low throughput qualitative gel-based technique to an easily automated, rapid, high throughput quantitative technology. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) has become the benchmark technology for the detection and quantification of nucleic acids in a research, diagnostic, forensic and biotechnology setting. However, ill-assorted pre-assay conditions, poor assay design and inappropriate data analysis methodologies have resulted in the recurrent publication of data that are at best inconsistent and at worst irrelevant and even misleading. Furthermore, there is a lamentable lack of transparency of reporting, with the "Materials and Methods" sections of many publications, especially those with high impact factors, not fit for the purpose of evaluating the quality of any reported qPCR data. This poses a challenge to the integrity of the scientific literature, with serious consequences not just for basic research, but potentially calamitous implications for drug development and disease monitoring. These issues are being addressed by a set of guidelines that propose a minimum standard for the provision of information for qPCR experiments ("MIQE"). MIQE aims to restructure to-day's free-for-all qPCR methods into a more consistent format that will encourage detailed auditing of experimental detail, data analysis and reporting principles. General implementation of these guidelines is an important requisite for the maturing of qPCR into a robust, accurate and reliable nucleic acid quantification technology.},

@article{Burr2011,
abstract = {The assembly of MHC class I molecules is governed by stringent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control mechanisms. MHC class I heavy chains that fail to achieve their native conformation in complex with $\beta$2-microglobulin ($\beta$2m) and peptide are targeted for ER-associated degradation. This requires ubiquitination of the MHC class I heavy chain and its dislocation from the ER to the cytosol for proteasome-mediated degradation, although the cellular machinery involved in this process is unknown. Using an siRNA functional screen in $\beta$2m-depleted cells, we identify an essential role for the E3 ligase HRD1 (Synoviolin) together with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2J1 in the ubiquitination and dislocation of misfolded MHC class I heavy chains. HRD1 is also required for the ubiquitination and degradation of the naturally occurring hemochromatosis-associated HFE-C282Y mutant, which is unable to bind $\beta$2m. In the absence of HRD1, misfolded HLA-B27 accumulated in cells with a normal MHC class I assembly pathway, and HRD1 depletion prevented the appearance of low levels of cytosolic unfolded MHC I heavy chains. HRD1 and UBE2J1 associate in a complex together with non-$\beta$2m bound MHC class I heavy chains, Derlin 1, and p97 and discriminate misfolded MHC class I from conformational MHC I-$\beta$2m-peptide heterotrimers. Together these data support a physiological role for HRD1 and UBE2J1 in the homeostatic regulation of MHC class I assembly and expression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The distinction between Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is unclear. We used transcriptional and genomic profiling to define Burkitt's lymphoma more precisely and to distinguish subgroups in other types of mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas. METHODS: We performed gene-expression profiling using Affymetrix U133A GeneChips with RNA from 220 mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas, including a core group of 8 Burkitt's lymphomas that met all World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. A molecular signature for Burkitt's lymphoma was generated, and chromosomal abnormalities were detected with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. RESULTS: We used the molecular signature for Burkitt's lymphoma to identify 44 cases: 11 had the morphologic features of diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas, 4 were unclassifiable mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas, and 29 had a classic or atypical Burkitt's morphologic appearance. Also, five did not have a detectable IG-myc Burkitt's translocation, whereas the others contained an IG-myc fusion, mostly in simple karyotypes. Of the 176 lymphomas without the molecular signature for Burkitt's lymphoma, 155 were diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas. Of these 155 cases, 21 percent had a chromosomal breakpoint at the myc locus associated with complex chromosomal changes and an unfavorable clinical course. CONCLUSIONS: Our molecular definition of Burkitt's lymphoma clarifies and extends the spectrum of the WHO criteria for Burkitt's lymphoma. In mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas without a gene signature for Burkitt's lymphoma, chromosomal breakpoints at the myc locus were associated with an adverse clinical outcome.},

Recent studies have shown that FBXW7/hCDC4 is mutated in a variety of human tumor types, suggesting that it is a general tumor suppressor in human cancer. Alteration of Fbxw7/hCdc4 function is linked to defects in differentiation, cellular proliferation, and genetic instability.

abstract = {PURPOSE: Several different multivariate prediction models using routine clinical variables or multigene signatures have been proposed to predict pathologic complete response to combination chemotherapy in breast cancer. Our goal was to compare the performance of four conceptually different predictors in an independent cohort of patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiling was done on fine-needle aspirations of 100 stage I to III breast cancers before preoperative paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide combination chemotherapy. Pathologic response was correlated with prediction results from a clinical nomogram, a human cancer-derived genomic predictor (DLDA30), a cell line-based genomic predictor [in vitro coexpression extrapolation (COXEN)], and an optimized cell line-derived (in vivo COXEN) predictor. None of the 100 test cases were used in the development of these predictors. RESULTS: The in vitro COXEN using a combination of four individual drug sensitivity predictions derived from cell lines was not predictive [area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), 0.5; 95\% confidence interval, (95\% CI), 0.41-0.59]. The clinical nomogram (AUC, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.65-0.80) and the DLDA30 (AUC, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.80) genomic predictor had similar performances. The in vivo COXEN that used informative genes from cell lines but was trained on a separate human data set also showed significant predictive value (AUC, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.60-0.74). These three different prediction scores correlated with each other and were significant in univariate but not in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Three conceptually different predictors performed similarly in this validation study and tended to identify the same patients as responders. A genomic predictor that relied solely on a composite of individual drug sensitivity predictions from cell lines did not show any predictive value.},

abstract = {There is a considerable variation in efficacy of melphalan therapy in multiple myeloma (MM) and other hematopoietic tumors. We hypothesized that this may be due to variations in the expression of influx and efflux transporters of melphalan. We measured the expression of the influx transporters LAT1, LAT2, and TAT1 and the efflux transporters MDR1, MRP1 and BCRP by quantitative RT-PCR and related their expression to the intracellular accumulation and cytotoxicity of melphalan in 7 MM and 21 non-MM hematopoietic tumor cell lines. Variation in the intracellular accumulation accounted for nearly half of the variation in the cytotoxicity of melphalan in MM cell lines (r(2)=0.47, P=0.04). High expression of the efflux transporter MDR1 was associated with low intracellular accumulation and low cytotoxicity of melphalan (r(2)=0.56, P=0.03 and r(2)=0.62, P=0.02, respectively). The effect was reversed by the MDR1 inhibitor cyclosporine. In addition, the MDR1 overexpressing HL-60 cell line showed 10-fold higher resistance to melphalan than the non-MDR1 expressing one. Again, the resistance was reversed by cyclosporine and by MDR1-specific shRNA. LAT1 was the major influx transporter in tumor cell lines with 4000-fold higher expression than LAT2. Down-regulation of LAT1 by siRNA reduced the melphalan uptake by 58\% and toxicity by 3.5-fold, but natural variation in expression between the tumor cell lines was not associated with accumulation or cytotoxicity of melphalan. In conclusion, tumor-specific variations in the expression of the efflux transporter MDR1, but not of the influx transporter LAT1, affect the intracellular accumulation of melphalan and thus determine its cytotoxicity.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Myeloma is a clonal malignancy of plasma cells. Poor-prognosis risk is currently identified by clinical and cytogenetic features. However, these indicators do not capture all prognostic information. Gene expression analysis can be used to identify poor-prognosis patients and this can be improved by combination with information about DNA-level changes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using single nucleotide polymorphism-based gene mapping in combination with global gene expression analysis, we have identified homozygous deletions in genes and networks that are relevant to myeloma pathogenesis and outcome. RESULTS: We identified 170 genes with homozygous deletions and corresponding loss of expression. Deletion within the "cell death" network was overrepresented and cases with these deletions had impaired overall survival. From further analysis of these events, we have generated an expression-based signature associated with shorter survival in 258 patients and confirmed this signature in data from two independent groups totaling 800 patients. We defined a gene expression signature of 97 cell death genes that reflects prognosis and confirmed this in two independent data sets. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a simple 6-gene expression signature from the 97-gene signature that can be used to identify poor-prognosis myeloma in the clinical environment. This signature could form the basis of future trials aimed at improving the outcome of poor-prognosis myeloma.},

For i = 1, 2, ..., p, let pi(i) denote the two-sided P-value associated with the ith feature Z-score and pi((i)) denote the ith order statistic of the collection of P-values. The HC threshold is the absolute Z-score corresponding to the P-value maximizing the HC objective (i/p - pi((i)))/sqrt\{i/p(1-i/p)\}. We consider a rare/weak (RW) feature model, where the fraction of useful features is small and the useful features are each too weak to be of much use on their own. HC thresholding (HCT) has interesting behavior in this setting, with an intimate link between maximizing the HC objective and minimizing the error rate of the designed classifier, and very different behavior from popular threshold selection procedures such as false discovery rate thresholding (FDRT). In the most challenging RW settings, HCT uses an unconventionally low threshold; this keeps the missed-feature detection rate under better control than FDRT and yields a classifier with improved misclassification performance. Replacing cross-validated threshold selection in the popular Shrunken Centroid classifier with the computationally less expensive and simpler HCT reduces the variance of the selected threshold and the error rate of the constructed classifier. Results on standard real datasets and in asymptotic theory confirm the advantages of HCT.},

Attesting to the molecular heterogeneity of MM, unsupervised classification using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) designed for array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis uncovered distinct genomic subtypes. Additionally, we defined 87 discrete minimal common regions (MCRs) within recurrent and highly focal CNAs. Further integration with expression data generated a refined list of MM gene candidates residing within these MCRs, thereby providing a genomic framework for dissection of disease pathogenesis, improved clinical management, and initiation of targeted drug discovery for specific MM patients.},

abstract = {B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) is the most common malignancy in children. The Wnt signaling pathway has been found to be extensively involved in cancer onset and progression but its role in BCP-ALL remains controversial. We evaluate the role of the Wnt pathway in maintenance of BCP-ALL cells and resistance to chemotherapy. Gene expression profile revealed that BCP-ALL cells are potentially sensitive to modulation of Wnt pathway. Nalm-16 and Nalm-6 cell lines displayed low levels of canonical activation, as reflected by the virtually complete absence of total beta-catenin in Nalm-6 and the beta-catenin cell membrane distribution in Nalm-16 cell line. Canonical activation with Wnt3a induced nuclear beta-catenin translocation and led to BCP-ALL cell death. Lithium chloride (LiCl) also induced a cytotoxic effect on leukemic cells. In contrast, both Wnt5a and Dkk-1 increased Nalm-16 cell survival. Also, Wnt3a enhanced the in vitro sensitivity of Nalm-16 to etoposide (VP-16) while treatment with canonical antagonists protected leukemic cells from chemotherapy-induced cell death. Overall, our results suggest that canonical activation of the Wnt pathway may exerts a tumor suppressive effect, thus its inhibition may support BCP-ALL cell survival.},

Furthermore, we provide evidence that Wnt-5a also acts in vivo to promote beta-catenin degradation in regulating mammalian limb development and possibly in suppressing tumor formation.},

Acquired resistance to the effects of chemotherapy has emerged as a significant impediment to effective cancer therapy.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously described gene-expression signatures that predict growth inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of common chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. The aim of this study was to confirm the validity of these gene-expression signatures in a large series of patients with oestrogen-receptor-negative breast tumours who were treated in a phase III neoadjuvant clinical trial. METHODS: This trial compares a non-taxane regimen (fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide [FEC] for six cycles) with a taxane regimen (docetaxel for three cycles followed by epirubicin plus docetaxel [TET] for three cycles) in women with oestrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer. The primary endpoint of the study is the difference in progression-free survival based on TP53 status and will be reported later. Predicting response with gene signatures was a planned secondary endpoint of the trial and is reported here. Pathological complete response, defined as complete disappearance of the tumour with no more than a few scattered tumour cells detected by the pathologist in the resection specimen, was used to assess chemosensitivity. RNA was prepared from sections of frozen biopsies taken at diagnosis and hybridised to Affymetrix X3P microarrays. In-vitro single-agent drug sensitivity signatures were combined to obtain FEC and TET regimen-specific signatures. This study is registered on the clinical trials site of the US National Cancer Institute website http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00017095. FINDINGS: Of 212 patients with oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours assessed, 87 patients were excluded. 125 oestrogen-receptor-negative tumours (55 that showed pathological complete responses) were tested: 66 in the FEC group (28 that showed pathological complete responses) and 59 in the TET group (27 that showed pathological complete responses). The regimen-specific signatures significantly predicted pathological complete response in patients treated with the appropriate regimen (p<0.0001). The FEC predictor had a sensitivity of 96\% (27 of 28 patients [95\% CI 82-99]), specificity of 66\% (25 of 38 patients [50-79]), positive predictive value (PPV) of 68\% (27 of 40 patients [52-80]), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 96\% (25 of 26 patients [81-99]). The TET predictor had a sensitivity of 93\% (25 of 27 patients [77-98]), specificity 69\% (22 of 32 patients [51-82]), PPV of 71\% (25 of 35 patients [55-84]), and NPV of 92\% (22 of 24 patients [74-98]). Analysis of tumour size, grade, nodal status, age, and regimen-specific signatures showed that the genomic signatures were the only independent variables predicting pathological complete response at p<0.01. Selection of patients with these signatures would increase the proportion of patients with pathological complete responses from 44\% to around 70\% in the patients studied here. INTERPRETATION: We have validated the use of regimen-specific drug sensitivity signatures in the context of a multicentre randomised trial. The high NPV of both signatures may allow early selection of patients with breast cancer who should be considered for trials with new drugs.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Despite objective response rates of only approximately 13\%, temozolomide remains one of the most effective single chemotherapy agents against metastatic melanoma, second only to dacarbazine, the current standard of care for systemic treatment of melanoma. The goal of this study was to identify molecular and/or genetic markers that correlate with, and could be used to predict, response to temozolomide-based treatment regimens and that reflect the intrinsic properties of a patient's tumor. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using a panel of 26 human melanoma-derived cell lines, we determined in vitro temozolomide sensitivity, O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) activity, MGMT protein expression and promoter methylation status, and mismatch repair proficiency, as well as the expression profile of 38,000 genes using an oligonucleotide-based microarray platform. RESULTS: The results showed a broad spectrum of temozolomide sensitivity across the panel of cell lines, with IC(50) values ranging from 100 micromol/L to 1 mmol/L. There was a significant correlation between measured temozolomide sensitivity and a gene expression signature-derived prediction of temozolomide sensitivity (P < 0.005). Notably, MGMT alone showed a significant correlation with temozolomide sensitivity (MGMT activity, P < 0.0001; MGMT expression, P <or= 0.0001). The promoter methylation status of the MGMT gene, however, was not consistent with MGMT gene expression or temozolomide sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that melanoma resistance to temozolomide is conferred predominantly by MGMT activity and suggest that MGMT expression could potentially be a useful tool for predicting the response of melanoma patients to temozolomide therapy.},

abstract = {The statistical treatment for hypothesis testing using real-time PCR data is a challenge for quantification of gene expression. One has to consider two key factors in precise statistical analysis of real-time PCR data: a well-defined statistical model and the integration of amplification efficiency (AE) into the model. Previous publications in real-time PCR data analysis often fall short in integrating the AE into the model. Novel, user-friendly, and universal AE-integrated statistical methods were developed for real-time PCR data analysis with four goals. First, we addressed the definition of AE, introduced the concept of efficiency-adjusted Delta Delta Ct, and developed a general mathematical method for its calculation. Second, we developed several linear combination approaches for the estimation of efficiency adjusted Delta Delta Ct and statistical significance for hypothesis testing based on different mathematical formulae and experimental designs. Statistical methods were also adopted to estimate the AE and its equivalence among the samples. A weighted Delta Delta Ct method was introduced to analyze the data with multiple internal controls. Third, we implemented the linear models with SAS programs and analyzed a set of data for each model. In order to allow other researchers to use and compare different approaches, SAS programs are included in the Supporting Information. Fourth, the results from analysis of different statistical models were compared and discussed. Our results underline the differences between the efficiency adjusted Delta Delta Ct methods and previously published methods, thereby better identifying and controlling the source of errors introduced by real-time PCR data analysis.},

abstract = {Melphalan is widely used as a preparative agent in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). Although disease relapse is the major cause of death after a melphalan-conditioned autograft, the mechanism remains unclear. Melphalan produces a number of DNA adducts with the DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) considered to be the critical cytotoxic lesion. By using a modification of the single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay, we have measured formation and repair of DNA ICL in plasma cells from melphalan- naive and melphalan-treated patients (ie, those who have relapsed after a melphalan-conditioned autologous SCT or oral melphalan therapy). Similar levels of dose-dependent DNA interstand crosslinking were observed in cells from both melphalan-naive and -treated patients. However, marked differences in ICL repair were observed: cells from naive patients showed no repair, whereas those from treated patients exhibited between 42\% and 100\% repair at 40 hours. In vitro sensitivity to melphalan in plasma cells was found to correlate with ICL repair. These findings suggest that ICL repair may be an important mechanism by which melphalan resistance emerges after autologous SCT or oral therapy. This mechanism may have implications for MM patients undergoing melphalan therapy.},

abstract = {The cell surface proteoglycan fraction isolated by mild trypsin treatment of NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells contains largely heparan sulfate, but also 15-24\% chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans. We conclude that this fraction contains a unique hybrid proteoglycan bearing both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans because (i) the proteoglycan behaves as a single species by sizing, ion exchange and collagen affinity chromatography, and by isopycnic centrifugation, even in the presence of 8 M urea or 4 M guanidine hydrochloride, (ii) the behavior of the chondroitin sulfate in these separation techniques is affected by heparan sulfate-specific probes and vice versa, and (iii) proteoglycan core protein bearing both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate is recognized by a single monoclonal antibody. Removal of both types of glycosaminoglycan reduces the proteoglycan to a core protein of approximately 53 kDa. The proteoglycan fraction is heterogeneous in size, largely due to a variable number and/or length of the glycosaminoglycan chains. We estimate that one or two chondroitin sulfate chains (modal Mr of 17,000) exist on the proteoglycan for every four heparan sulfate chains (modal Mr of 36,000). Synthesis of these chains is reportedly initiated on an identical trisaccharide that links the chains to the same amino acid residues on the core protein. Therefore, some regulatory information, perhaps residing in the amino acid sequence of the core protein, must determine the type of chain synthesized at any given linkage site. Post-translational addition of these glycosaminoglycans to the protein may provide information affecting its ultimate localization. It is likely that the protein is directed to specific sites on the cell surface because of the ability of the glycosaminoglycans to recognize and bind extracellular components.},

We show that known asymptotic consistency of the partial least squares estimator for a univariate response does not hold with the very large p and small n paradigm. We derive a similar result for a multivariate response regression with partial least squares. We then propose a sparse partial least squares formulation which aims simultaneously to achieve good predictive performance and variable selection by producing sparse linear combinations of the original predictors. We provide an efficient implementation of sparse partial least squares regression and compare it with well-known variable selection and dimension reduction approaches via simulation experiments. We illustrate the practical utility of sparse partial least squares regression in a joint analysis of gene expression and genomewide binding data.},

abstract = {The intimate relationship between DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and cancer susceptibility has sparked profound interest in how transactions on DNA and chromatin surrounding DNA damage influence genome integrity. Recent evidence implicates a substantial commitment of the cellular DNA damage response machinery to the synthesis, recognition, and hydrolysis of ubiquitin chains at DNA damage sites. In this review, we propose that, in order to accommodate parallel processes involved in DSB repair and checkpoint signaling, DSB-associated ubiquitin structures must be nonuniform, using different linkages for distinct functional outputs. We highlight recent advances in the study of nondegradative ubiquitin signaling at DSBs, and discuss how recognition of different ubiquitin structures may influence DNA damage responses.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Standard treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) includes the use of a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. However, response rates are highly variable. Newer agents, such as pemetrexed, have shown significant activity as second-line therapy and are currently being evaluated in the front-line setting. We utilized a genomic strategy to develop signatures predictive of chemotherapeutic response to both cisplatin and pemetrexed to provide a rational approach to effective individualized medicine. METHODS: Using in vitro drug sensitivity data, coupled with microarray data, we developed gene expression signatures predicting sensitivity to cisplatin and pemetrexed. Signatures were validated with response data from 32 independent ovarian and lung cancer cell lines as well as 59 samples from patients previously treated with cisplatin. RESULTS: Genomic-derived signatures of cisplatin and pemetrexed sensitivity were shown to accurately predict sensitivity in vitro and, in the case of cisplatin, to predict treatment response in patients treated with cisplatin. The accuracy of the cisplatin predictor, based on available clinical data, was 83.1\% (sensitivity, 100\%; specificity 57\%; positive predictive value, 78\%; negative predictive value, 100\%). Interestingly, an inverse correlation was seen between in vitro cisplatin and pemetrexed sensitivity, and importantly, between the likelihood of cisplatin and pemetrexed response in patients. CONCLUSION: The use of genomic predictors of response to cisplatin and pemetrexed can be incorporated into strategies to optimize therapy for advanced solid tumors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), or R-CHOP, has significantly improved the survival of patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. Whether gene-expression signatures correlate with survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is unclear. METHODS: We profiled gene expression in pretreatment biopsy specimens from 181 patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma who received CHOP and 233 patients with this disease who received R-CHOP. A multivariate gene-expression-based survival-predictor model derived from a training group was tested in a validation group. RESULTS: A multivariate model created from three gene-expression signatures--termed "germinal-center B-cell," "stromal-1," and "stromal-2"--predicted survival both in patients who received CHOP and patients who received R-CHOP. The prognostically favorable stromal-1 signature reflected extracellular-matrix deposition and histiocytic infiltration. By contrast, the prognostically unfavorable stromal-2 signature reflected tumor blood-vessel density. CONCLUSIONS: Survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is influenced by differences in immune cells, fibrosis, and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment.},

abstract = {Profiling studies using microarrays to measure messenger RNA (mRNA) expression frequently identify long lists of differentially expressed genes. Differential expression is often validated using real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays. In conventional real-time RT-PCR assays, expression is normalized to a control, or housekeeping gene. However, no single housekeeping gene can be used for all studies. We used TaqMan Low-Density Arrays, a medium-throughput method for real-time RT-PCR using microfluidics to simultaneously assay the expression of 96 genes in nine samples of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We developed a novel statistical method, based on linear mixed-effects models, to analyze the data. This method automatically identifies the genes whose expression does not vary significantly over the samples, allowing them to be used to normalize the remaining genes. We compared the normalized real-time RT-PCR values with results obtained from Affymetrix Hu133A GeneChip oligonucleotide microarrays. We found that real-time RT-PCR using TaqMan Low-Density Arrays yielded reproducible measurements over seven orders of magnitude. Our model identified numerous genes that were expressed at nearly constant levels, including the housekeeping genes PGK1, GAPD, GUSB, TFRC, and 18S rRNA. After normalizing to the geometric mean of the unvarying genes, the correlation between real-time RT-PCR and microarrays was high for genes that were moderately expressed and varied across samples.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To review the clinical pharmacology and clinical trials that have used intravenous (IV) high-dose melphalan (HDM). METHODS: We reviewed the mechanism of action, clinical pharmacology, and clinical studies of HDM with and without autologous bone marrow support (ABMT) or peripheral-blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) in the following disease areas: myeloma, ovarian cancer, malignant lymphoma, breast cancer, neuroblastoma, Ewing's sarcoma, and acute leukemia. RESULTS: HDM has a distribution half-life (t1/2 alpha) of 5 to 15 minutes and an elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) of 17 to 75 minutes at doses of 140 to 180 mg/m2, with significant intrapatient variability. At these doses, a wide range of areas under the concentration/time curve (AUC) have been reported, ie, 146 to 1,515 mg/min/mL. HDM has significant clinical activity in patients with multiple myeloma in relapse or when used as consolidative therapy in relapsed ovarian cancer, relapsed Hodgkin's disease, breast cancer, and relapsed neuroblastoma. Additional studies are required to determine the activity of HDM in Ewing's sarcoma or acute leukemia. Toxicities of HDM include myelosuppression, moderate nausea and vomiting, moderate to severe mucositis and diarrhea, and, infrequently, hepatic venoocclusive disease. CONCLUSION: HDM has become an established and effective salvage regimen for children with relapsed neuroblastoma, as well as an effective consolidative treatment for children with high-risk disease (stage IV). HDM is emerging as an active and effective mode of treatment in patients with stage II and III myeloma. The favorable toxicity profile of HDM and the availability of PBPCs allows for repetitive therapy.},

Later, drugs from other therapeutic groups were also described as substrates, including antibiotics, antivirals, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and flavonoids. An expanding list of compounds inhibiting ABCG2 has also been generated. The wide variety of drugs transported by ABCG2 and its normal tissue distribution with highest levels in the placenta, intestine and liver, suggest a role in protection against xenobiotics. ABCG2 also has an important role in the pharmacokinetics of its substrates. Single nucleotide polymorphisms of the gene were shown to alter either plasma concentrations of substrate drugs or levels of resistance against chemotherapeutic agents in cell lines. ABCG2 was also described as the determinant of the side population of stem cells. All these aspects of the transporter warrant further research aimed at understanding ABCG2's structure, function and regulation of expression.},

abstract = {To better define the molecular basis of multiple myeloma (MM), we performed unsupervised hierarchic clustering of mRNA expression profiles in CD138-enriched plasma cells from 414 newly diagnosed patients who went on to receive high-dose therapy and tandem stem cell transplants. Seven disease subtypes were validated that were strongly influenced by known genetic lesions, such as c-MAF- and MAFB-, CCND1- and CCND3-, and MMSET-activating translocations and hyperdiploidy. Indicative of the deregulation of common pathways by gene orthologs, common gene signatures were observed in cases with c-MAF and MAFB activation and CCND1 and CCND3 activation, the latter consisting of 2 subgroups, one characterized by expression of the early B-cell markers CD20 and PAX5. A low incidence of focal bone disease distinguished one and increased expression of proliferation-associated genes of another novel subgroup. Comprising varying fractions of each of the other 6 subgroups, the proliferation subgroup dominated at relapse, suggesting that this signature is linked to disease progression. Proliferation and MMSET-spike groups were characterized by significant overexpression of genes mapping to chromosome 1q, and both exhibited a poor prognosis relative to the other groups. A subset of cases with a predominating myeloid gene expression signature, excluded from the profiling analyses, had more favorable baseline characteristics and superior prognosis to those lacking this signature.},

ET-743 and PM00104 exposure over sustained periods of treatment will result in the development of drug resistance, but the mechanisms which lead to resistance are not yet understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Human chondrosarcoma cell lines resistant to ET-743 (CS-1/ER) or PM00104 (CS-1/PR) were established in this study. The CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR exhibited cross resistance to cisplatin and methotrexate but not to doxorubicin. Human Affymetrix Gene Chip arrays were used to examine relative gene expression in these cell lines. We found that a large number of genes have altered expression levels in CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR when compared to the parental cell line. 595 CS-1/ER and 498 CS-1/PR genes were identified as overexpressing; 856 CS-1/ER and 874 CS-1/PR transcripts were identified as underexpressing. Three zinc finger protein (ZNF) genes were on the top 10 overexpressed genes list. These genes have not been previously associated with drug resistance in tumor cells. Differential expressions of ZNF93 and ZNF43 genes were confirmed in both CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR resistant cell lines by real-time RT-PCR. ZNF93 was overexpressed in two ET-743 resistant Ewing sarcoma cell lines as well as in a cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cell line, but was not overexpressed in paclitaxel resistant cell lines. ZNF93 knockdown by siRNA in CS-1/ER and CS-1/PR caused increased sensitivity for ET-743, PM00104, and cisplatin. Furthermore, ZNF93 transfected CS-1 cells are relatively resistant to ET-743, PM00104 and cisplatin. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study suggests that zinc finger proteins, and ZNF93 in particular, are involved in resistance to ET-743 and PM00104.},

Real-time PCR is easy to perform, provides the necessary accuracy and produces reliable as well as rapid quantification results. But accurate quantification of nucleic acids requires a reproducible methodology and an adequate mathematical model for data analysis. This study enters into the particular topics of the relative quantification in real-time RT-PCR of a target gene transcript in comparison to a reference gene transcript. Therefore, a new mathematical model is presented. The relative expression ratio is calculated only from the real-time PCR efficiencies and the crossing point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. This model needs no calibration curve. Control levels were included in the model to standardise each reaction run with respect to RNA integrity, sample loading and inter-PCR variations. High accuracy and reproducibility (<2.5\% variation) were reached in LightCycler PCR using the established mathematical model.},

abstract = {Syndecan-1 is a proteoglycan that concentrates heparin-binding factors on the surface of multiple myeloma cells, and probably plays a major role in multiple myeloma biology. As heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate are the bioactive components of syndecan-1, we analysed the signature of genes encoding 100 proteins involved in synthesis of these chains, i.e. from precursor uptake to post-translational modifications, using Affymetrix microarrays. The expression of enzymes required for heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate biosynthesis was shown to increase in parallel with syndecan-1 expression, throughout the differentiation of memory B cells into plasmablasts and normal bone marrow plasma cells. Sixteen genes were significantly different between normal and malignant plasma cells, nine of these genes -EXT2, CHSY3, CSGALNACT1, HS3ST2, HS2ST1, CHST11, CSGALNACT2, HPSE, SULF2 - encode proteins involved in glycosaminoglycan chain synthesis or modifications. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed in two independent series of patients: B4GALT7, CSGALNACT1, HS2ST1 were associated with a good prognosis whereas EXT1 was linked to a bad prognosis. This study provides an overall picture of the major genes encoding for proteins involved in heparan sulphate and chondroitin sulphate synthesis and modifications that can be implicated in normal and malignant plasma cells.},

Using these data, we linked bioinformatics and chemoinformatics by correlating gene expression and drug activity patterns in the NCI60 lines. Clustering the cell lines on the basis of gene expression yielded relationships very different from those obtained by clustering the cell lines on the basis of their response to drugs. Gene-drug relationships for the clinical agents 5-fluorouracil and L-asparaginase exemplify how variations in the transcript levels of particular genes relate to mechanisms of drug sensitivity and resistance.

abstract = {There appear to be two pathways involved in the pathogenesis of premalignant non-immunoglobulin M (IgM) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM). Nearly half of tumors are nonhyperdiploid, and mostly have one of five recurrent IgH translocations: 16\% 11q13 (CCN D1), 3\% 6p21 (CCN D3), 5\% 16q23 (MAF), 2\% 20q12 (MAFB), and 15\% 4p16 (FGFR3 and MMSET). The remaining hyperdiploid tumors have multiple trisomies involving chromosomes 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 19, and 21, and infrequently one of these five translocations. Although cyclin D1 is not expressed by healthy lymphoid cells, it is bi-allelically dysregulated in a majority of hyperdiploid tumors. Virtually all MM and MGUS tumors have dysregulated and/or increased expression of cyclin D1, D2, or D3, providing an apparent early, unifying event in pathogenesis. The patterns of translocations and cyclin D expression (TC) define a novel classification that includes eight groups: 11q; 6p; MAF; 4p; D1 (34\%); D1+D2 (6\%); D2 (17\%); and none (2\%). The hyperdiploid D1 group is virtually absent in extramedullary MM and MM cell lines, suggesting a particularly strong dependence on interaction with the bone marrow microenvironment. Despite shared progression events (RAS mutations, MYC dysregulation, p53 mutations, and additional disruption of the retinoblastoma pathway), the phenotypes of MGUS and MM tumors in the eight TC groups is determined mainly by early oncogenic events. Similar to acute lymphocytic leukemia, MM seems to include several diseases (groups) that have differences in early or initiating events, global gene expression patterns, bone marrow dependence, clinical features, prognosis, and response to therapy.},

abstract = {Melphalan, a DNA cross-linker, is one of the most widely used and effective drugs in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). In this report, we demonstrate that enhanced interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair via the Fanconi anemia (FA)/BRCA pathway contributes to acquired drug resistance in melphalan-resistant myeloma cell lines, and disruption of this pathway reverses drug resistance. Using the alkaline comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis), we observed that melphalan-resistant cells have reduced ICL formation and enhanced ICL repair compared with melphalan-sensitive cells. Cell-cycle studies demonstrated that enhanced ICL repair released cells from melphalan-induced cell-cycle delay. Using siRNA to knock down FANCF in 8226/LR5 and U266/LR6 drug-resistant cells demonstrated a direct relationship between ICL repair capacity and drug sensitivity. Overexpression of FANCF in 8226/S and U266/S drug-sensitive cells partially reproduced the drug-resistant phenotype. These data show that enhanced DNA repair via the Fanconi anemia/BRCA pathway is involved in acquired melphalan resistance. Our findings provide for a new target to enhance response to DNA cross-linking agents in cancer treatment.},

abstract = {To identify p53-target genes we have been using a cDNA-microarray system to assess gene expression in a p53-mutated glioblastoma cell line (U373MG) after adenovirus-mediated transfer of wild-type p53 into the p53-deficient cells. In the work reported here, expression of hCDC4b, which encodes one of the four subunits of the SCF (ubiquitin ligase) complex responsible for degradation of cyclin E, was dramatically up-regulated by infection with Ad-p53. An electrophoretic mobility-shift assay and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that a potential p53-binding site (p53BS) present in exon 1b of the hCDC4 gene was able to bind to p53, and a reporter assay confirmed that this p53BS had p53-dependent transcriptional activity. Expression of endogenous hCDC4b, but not the alternative transcript of this gene, hCDC4a, was induced in a p53-dependent manner in response to genotoxic stresses caused by UV irradiation and adriamycin treatment, suggesting that each transcript has a different functional role. These results suggest that hCDC4b is a previously unrecognized transcriptional target of the p53 protein, and that by negatively regulating cyclin E through induction of hCDC4b, p53 might stop cell-cycle progression at G0-G1. This would represent a novel mechanism for p53-dependent control of the cell cycle, in addition to the well-known p21(WAF1) machinery.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Chromosomal aberrations are a hallmark of multiple myeloma but their global prognostic impact is largely unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a genome-wide analysis of malignant plasma cells from 192 newly diagnosed patients with myeloma using high-density, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to identify genetic lesions associated with prognosis. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed deletions and amplifications in 98\% of patients. Amplifications in 1q and deletions in 1p, 12p, 14q, 16q, and 22q were the most frequent lesions associated with adverse prognosis, whereas recurrent amplifications of chromosomes 5, 9, 11, 15, and 19 conferred a favorable prognosis. Multivariate analysis retained three independent lesions: amp(1q23.3), amp(5q31.3), and del(12p13.31). When adjusted to the established prognostic variables (ie, t(4;14), del(17p), and serum beta(2)-microglobulin [Sbeta(2)M]), del(12p13.31) remained the most powerful independent adverse marker (P < .0001; hazard ratio [HR], 3.17) followed by Sbeta(2)M (P < .0001; HR, 2.78) and the favorable marker amp(5q31.3) (P = .0005; HR, 0.37). Patients with amp(5q31.3) alone and low Sbeta(2)M had an excellent prognosis (5-year overall survival, 87\%); conversely, patients with del(12p13.31) alone or amp(5q31.3) and del(12p13.31) and high Sbeta(2)M had a very poor outcome (5-year overall survival, 20\%). This prognostic model was validated in an independent validation cohort of 273 patients with myeloma. CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate the power and accessibility of molecular karyotyping to predict outcome in myeloma. In addition, integration of expression of genes residing in the lesions of interest revealed putative features of the disease driving short survival.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-dose therapy with melphalan can prolong survival among patients with multiple myeloma. We assessed whether the addition of thalidomide, which has activity against advanced and refractory myeloma, would further improve survival. METHODS: Between October 1998 and February 2004, 668 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma received two cycles of intensive melphalan-based chemotherapy, each supported by autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. A total of 323 were randomly assigned to receive thalidomide from the outset until disease progression or undue adverse effects, and 345 did not receive thalidomide. The primary end point was the five-year event-free survival rate. Secondary end points were complete response and overall survival. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 42 months among survivors, the thalidomide and control groups had rates of complete response of 62 percent and 43 percent, respectively (P<0.001), and five-year event-free survival rates of 56 percent and 44 percent (P=0.01). The five-year rate of overall survival was approximately 65 percent in both groups (P=0.90). Median survival after relapse was 1.1 years in the thalidomide group and 2.7 years in the control group (P=0.001). Severe peripheral neuropathy and deep-vein thrombosis occurred more frequently in the thalidomide group than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: When incorporated into high-dose therapy for myeloma, thalidomide increased the frequency of complete responses and extended event-free survival at the expense of added adverse effects without improving overall survival.

Recent studies implicate some TLRs in tumor development based on their ability to facilitate tumor growth; however, to our knowledge, involvement of neither TLR7 nor TLR78 has yet been demonstrated. Here we have demonstrated expression of TLR7 and TLR8, the natural receptors for single-stranded RNA, by tumor cells in human lung cancer in situ and in human lung tumor cell lines. Stimulation with TLR7 or TLR8 agonists led to activated NF-kappaB, upregulated expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2, increased tumor cell survival, and chemoresistance. Transcriptional analysis performed on human primary lung tumor cells and TLR7- or TLR8-stimulated human lung tumor cell lines revealed a gene expression signature suggestive of chronic stimulation of tumor cells by TLR ligands in situ. Together, these data emphasize that TLR signaling can directly favor tumor development and further suggest that researchers developing anticancer immunotherapy using TLR7 or TLR8 agonists as adjuvants should take into account the expression of these TLRs in lung tumor cells.},

A majority of primary myeloma patient samples and cell lines had elevated NF-kappaB target gene expression, often associated with genetic or epigenetic alteration of NIK, TRAF3, CYLD, BIRC2/BIRC3, CD40, NFKB1, or NFKB2.

abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM) is a neoplasm of a terminally differentiated B-cell. The disease is progressive and always lethal characterized by the slow proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. Much of our current understanding of the biology of MM has been obtained by studying MM-derived cell lines. Human myeloma cell lines were shown to be suitable model systems for use in various fields of the biological sciences. However, it has proved very difficult to establish cell lines from plasma cell dyscrasias. Most reported MM cell lines have been derived from patients with advanced disease and from extramedullary sites. Nevertheless, within the last 20 years more than 100 cell lines have been established. A significant portion of this panel is partially or well characterized with regard to their cell culture, clinical, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and functional features. Distinct immunoprofiles could be assigned to MM cell lines. All MM cell lines display chromosomal aberrations; in more than 80\% of the cell lines analyzed, chromosome 14 band q32 (immunoglobulin heavy chain locus) is affected; the various types of 14q+ chromosomes showed different distributions among the MM cell lines. A large percentage of MM cell lines is constitutively interleukin-6-dependent or responsive to various cytokines. It is important to realize that not every cell line established from a patient with myeloma is a neoplastic cell line. So-called 'myeloma cell lines' have been previously reported and are still widely used which are in reality Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. The presence of the EBV-genome in residual normal B-cells provides them with a selective growth advantage after explantation. In summary, a significant number of authentic and well-characterized MM cell lines has been established and described. The availability of these bona fide MM cell lines is of great importance for the study of the biology, etiology and treatment of the disease.},

abstract = {The U.S. National Cancer Institute has used a panel of 60 diverse human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) to screen >100,000 chemical compounds for anticancer activity. However, not all important cancer types are included in the panel, nor are drug responses of the panel predictive of clinical efficacy in patients. We asked, therefore, whether it would be possible to extrapolate from that rich database (or analogous ones from other drug screens) to predict activity in cell types not included or, for that matter, clinical responses in patients with tumors. We address that challenge by developing and applying an algorithm we term "coexpression extrapolation" (COXEN). COXEN uses expression microarray data as a Rosetta Stone for translating from drug activities in the NCI-60 to drug activities in any other cell panel or set of clinical tumors. Here, we show that COXEN can accurately predict drug sensitivity of bladder cancer cell lines and clinical responses of breast cancer patients treated with commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, we used COXEN for in silico screening of 45,545 compounds and identify an agent with activity against human bladder cancer.},

abstract = {Real-time RT-PCR has been frequently used in quantitative research in molecular biology and bioinformatics. It provides remarkably useful technology to assess expression of genes. Although mathematical models for gene amplification process have been studied, statistical models and methods for data analysis in real-time RT-PCR have received little attention. In this paper, we briefly introduce current mathematical models, and study statistical models for real-time RT-PCR data. We propose a generalized estimation equations (GEE) model that properly reflects the structure of repeated data in RT-PCR experiments for both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. The GEE model takes the correlation between observations within the same subjects into consideration, and prevents from producing false positives or false negatives. We further demonstrate with a set of actual real-time RT-PCR data that different statistical models yield different estimations of fold change and confidence interval. The SAS program for data analysis using the GEE model is provided to facilitate easy computation for non-statistical professionals.},

Hierarchical clustering identified 10 distinct subgroups, of which six corresponded to clusters described in the UAMS classification, i.e. CD-1 (n=13, 4.1\%), CD-2 (n=34, 10.6\%), MF (n=32, 10.0\%), MS (n=33, 10.3\%), PR (n=15, 4.7\%), and HY (n=77, 24.1\%). Moreover, the UAMS LB cluster was identified as a subcluster of the MF cluster (n=15, 4.7\%). In addition, one subgroup (n=39, 12.2\%) showed a myeloid signature. Three novel subgroups were defined, including a subgroup of 37 patients (11.6\%) characterized by high expression of genes involved in the NFkappaB pathway, which include TNFAIP3 and CD40. Another subgroup of 22 patients (6.9\%) was characterized by distinct overexpression of cancer testis antigens without overexpression of proliferation genes. The third novel cluster of 9 patients (2.8\%) showed upregulation of protein tyrosine phosphatases PRL-3 and PTPRZ1 as well as SOCS3. To conclude, in addition to seven clusters described in the UAMS classification, we identified three novel subsets of MM, which may represent unique diagnostic entities.},

@article{Yang2006,
abstract = {We previously reported the identification of a new family of plant methyltransferases (MTs), named the SABATH family, that use S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to methylate a carboxyl moiety or a nitrogen-containing functional group on a diverse array of plant compounds. The Arabidopsis genome alone contains 24 distinct SABATH genes. To identify the catalytic specificities of members of this protein family in Arabidopsis, we screened recombinantly expressed and purified enzymes with a large number of potential substrates. Here,we report that the Arabidopsis thaliana gene At3g44860 encodes a protein with high catalytic specificity towards farnesoic acid (FA). Under steady-state conditions, this farnesoic acid carboxyl methyltransferase (FAMT) exhibits KM values of 41 and 71 microM for FA and SAM, respectively. A three-dimensional model of FAMT constructed based upon similarity to the experimentally determined structure of Clarkia breweri salicylic acid methyltransferase (SAMT) suggests a reasonable model for FA recognition in the FAMT active site. In planta, the mRNA levels of At3g44860 increase in response to the exogenous addition of several compounds previously shown to induce plant defense responses at the transcriptional level. Although methyl farnesoate (MeFA) has not yet been detected in Arabidopsis, the presence of a FA-specific carboxyl methyltransferase in Arabidopsis capable of producing MeFA, an insect juvenile hormone made by some plants as a presumed defense against insect herbivory, suggests that MeFA or chemically similar compounds are likely to serve as new specialized metabolites in Arabidopsis.},

abstract = {To classify cancer specimens by their gene expression profiles, we created a statistical method based on Bayes' rule that estimates the probability of membership in one of two cancer subgroups. We used this method to classify diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) biopsy samples into two gene expression subgroups based on data obtained from spotted cDNA microarrays. The germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subgroup expressed genes characteristic of normal germinal center B cells whereas the activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL subgroup expressed a subset of the genes that are characteristic of plasma cells, particularly those encoding endoplasmic reticulum and golgi proteins involved in secretion. We next used this predictor to discover these subgroups within a second set of DLBCL biopsies that had been profiled by using oligonucleotide microarrays [Shipp, M. A., et al. (2002) Nat. Med. 8, 68-74]. The GCB and ABC DLBCL subgroups identified in this data set had significantly different 5-yr survival rates after multiagent chemotherapy (62\% vs. 26\%; P < or = 0.0051), in accord with analyses of other DLBCL cohorts. These results demonstrate the ability of this gene expression-based predictor to classify DLBCLs into biologically and clinically distinct subgroups irrespective of the method used to measure gene expression.},

abstract = {Glioblastoma are rapidly proliferating brain tumors in which hypoxia is readily recognizable, as indicated by focal or extensive necrosis and vascular proliferation, two independent diagnostic criteria for glioblastoma. Gene expression profiling of glioblastoma revealed a gene expression signature associated with hypoxia-regulated genes. The correlated gene set emerging from unsupervised analysis comprised known hypoxia-inducible genes involved in angiogenesis and inflammation such as VEGF and BIRC3, respectively. The relationship between hypoxia-modulated angiogenic genes and inflammatory genes was associated with outcome in our cohort of glioblastoma patients treated within prospective clinical trials of combined chemoradiotherapy. The hypoxia regulation of several new genes comprised in this cluster including ZNF395, TNFAIP3, and TREM1 was experimentally confirmed in glioma cell lines and primary monocytes exposed to hypoxia in vitro. Interestingly, the cluster seems to characterize differential response of tumor cells, stromal cells and the macrophage/microglia compartment to hypoxic conditions. Most genes classically associated with the inflammatory compartment are part of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway including TNFAIP3 and BIRC3 that have been shown to be involved in resistance to chemotherapy.Our results associate hypoxia-driven tumor response with inflammation in glioblastoma, hence underlining the importance of tumor-host interaction involving the inflammatory compartment.},

abstract = {We present data describing a human myeloma cell line (8226/LR-5) selected for resistance to melphalan which exhibits a 7-fold level of resistance to melphalan and is partially cross-resistant to other bifunctional alkylators and X-irradiation. Melphalan resistance is relatively unstable with a decrease in resistance observed within 17 weeks in the absence of drug. The resistance observed in this cell line is not mediated by reduced intracellular melphalan accumulation. DNA interstrand cross-linking at equivalent intracellular drug accumulation is significantly reduced in the resistant subline. Whether this reduction is the result of a decrease in the formation of this lesion or to an increased rate of removal of the lesion remains to be determined. Growth characteristics and cell cycle kinetics, including S phase, were similar between sensitive and resistant cell lines. Intracellular nonprotein thiols were found to be significantly elevated in the resistant 8226/LR-5 cells; as cells revert or lose resistance, intracellular nonprotein sulfhydryl levels decline. Prior treatment of the cells with buthionine sulfoximine significantly reduced nonprotein sulfhydryl levels and enhanced melphalan cytotoxicity in both the sensitive and resistant cell lines. Thiols appear to play a role in mediating melphalan resistance.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and multiple myeloma (MM) comprise heterogeneous disorders with incompletely understood molecular defects and variable clinical features. We performed gene expression profiling (GEP) with microarray data to better dissect the molecular phenotypes, sensitivity to particular chemotherapeutic agents, and prognoses of these diseases. METHODS: Using gene expression and clinical data from 877 patients ranging from normal plasma cells (NPC) to relapsed MM (RMM), we applied gene expression signatures reflecting deregulation of oncogenic pathways and tumor microenvironment to highlight molecular changes that occur as NPCs transition to MM, create a high-risk MGUS gene signature, and subgroup International Staging System (ISS) stages into more prognostically accurate clusters of patients. Lastly, we used gene signatures to predict sensitivity to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies among identified clusters of patients. RESULTS: Myc upregulation and increasing chromosomal instability (CIN) characterized the evolution from NPC to RMM (P < .0001 for both). Studies of MGUS revealed that some samples shared biologic features with RMM, which comprised the basis for a high-risk MGUS signature. Regarding MM, we subclassified ISS stages into clusters based on shared features of tumor biology. These clusters differentiated themselves based on predictions for prognosis and chemotherapy sensitivity (eg, in ISS stage I, one cluster was characterized by increased CIN, cyclophosphamide resistance, and a poor prognosis). CONCLUSION: GEP provides insight into the molecular defects underlying plasma cell dyscrasias that may explain their clinical heterogeneity. GEP also may also refine current prognostic and therapeutic models for MGUS and MM.},

MM is the second most frequent hematologic cancer in the United States, and it remains incurable, thereby highlighting the need for new therapeutic approaches, particularly those targeting common molecular pathways involved in disease progression and maintenance, shared across different MM subtypes. Here we report that Wnt/beta-catenin is one such pathway. We document the involvement of beta-catenin in cell-cycle regulation, proliferation, and invasion contributing to enhanced proliferative and metastatic properties of MM. The pleiotropic effects of beta-catenin in MM correlate with its transcriptional function, and we demonstrate regulation of a novel target gene, Aurora kinase A, implicating beta-catenin in G2/M regulation. beta-catenin and Aurora kinase A are present in most MM but not in normal plasma cells and are expressed in a pattern that parallels progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to MM. Our data provide evidence for a novel functional link between beta-catenin and Aurora kinase A, underscoring a critical role of these pathways in MM disease progression.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To use European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry data to assess the benefit and optimal timing of a double-autologous transplantation strategy for patients with myeloma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 7,452 transplantation patients described as being either in a multiple graft program ("planned") or not, were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. Subsequent multivariate analyses concentrated on the real occurrence of second transplantation, survival, relapse, and transplant-related mortality. RESULTS: Although the transplantation rate in the planned group failed to reach 60\%, the median survival from transplantation is 60 months for the planned, compared with 51 months for the remainder group. While the hazard ratio of the planned group is 0.89 (95\% CI, 0.79 to 1.00; P =.05) before approximately 70 months, this "effect" is reversed after 70 months, with the hazard ratio estimated as 3.01 (95\% CI, 1.07 to 8.46; P =.04). A time-dependent multivariate Cox analysis shows that, taking patients without a second transplantation as a reference group, those receiving a second transplantation in first remission (ie, before relapse) show an increased probability of transplant-related mortality, especially if the transplantation is performed more than 12 months after the first, and the reduction of the risk of relapse is less than when the transplantation is performed earlier. Performing a second transplantation after relapse does not seem to prolong survival, though a second transplantation before relapse is associated with a higher probability of mortality. CONCLUSION: To improve survival of tandem autologous transplantation in multiple myeloma, the second transplantation should preferably be performed before relapse and within 6 to 12 months of the first transplantation.},

Several investigational approaches to display, analysis, and interpretation of such profiles and databases, derived from the testing of tens of thousands of substances during the past 4-5 years since the NCI screen became fully operational, have been explored. A variety of useful, practical applications of the in vitro screen have become apparent. As these applications continue to evolve, they are proving to be complementary to diverse other anticancer screening and drug discovery strategies being developed or pursued elsewhere. Reviewed herein are some practical considerations and selected specific examples, particularly illustrating research applications of the NCI screen that may be more broadly applicable to the search for new anticancer drug development leads with novel profiles of antitumor activity and/or mechanisms of action. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {In order to identify relevant, molecularly defined subgroups in Multiple Myeloma (MM), gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed on purified CD138+ plasma cells of 320 newly diagnosed myeloma patients included in the Dutch-Belgian/German HOVON-65/ GMMG-HD4 trial using Affymetrix Gene Chip U133 plus 2.0 arrays. Hierarchical clustering identified 10 distinct subgroups, of which six corresponded to clusters described in the UAMS classification, i.e. CD-1 (n=13, 4.1\%), CD-2 (n=34, 10.6\%), MF (n=32, 10.0\%), MS (n=33, 10.3\%), PR (n=15, 4.7\%), and HY (n=77, 24.1\%). Moreover, the UAMS LB cluster was identified as a subcluster of the MF cluster (n=15, 4.7\%). In addition, one subgroup (n=39, 12.2\%) showed a myeloid signature. Three novel subgroups were defined, including a subgroup of 37 patients (11.6\%) characterized by high expression of genes involved in the NFkappaB pathway, which include TNFAIP3 and CD40. Another subgroup of 22 patients (6.9\%) was characterized by distinct overexpression of cancer testis antigens without overexpression of proliferation genes. The third novel cluster of 9 patients (2.8\%) showed upregulation of protein tyrosine phosphatases PRL-3 and PTPRZ1 as well as SOCS3. To conclude, in addition to seven clusters described in the UAMS classification, we identified three novel subsets of MM, which may represent unique diagnostic entities.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that regulate global gene expression. miRNAs often act synergistically to repress target genes, and their dysregulation can contribute to the initiation and progression of a variety of cancers. The clinical relationship between global expression of miRNA and mRNA in cancer has not been studied in detail. We used whole-genome microarray analyses of CD138-enriched plasma cells from 52 newly diagnosed cases of multiple myeloma to correlate miRNA expression profiles with a validated mRNA-based risk stratification score, proliferation index, and predefined gene sets. In stark contrast to mRNAs, we discovered that all tested miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in high-risk disease as defined by a validated 70-gene risk score (P < 0.01) and proliferation index (P < 0.05). Increased expression of EIF2C2/AGO2, a master regulator of the maturation and function of miRNAs and a component of the 70-gene mRNA risk model, is driven by DNA copy number gains in MM. Silencing of AGO2 dramatically decreased viability in MM cell lines. Genome-wide elevated expression of miRNAs in high-risk MM may be secondary to deregulation of AGO2 and the enzyme complexes that regulate miRNA maturation and function.},

abstract = {To obtain a comprehensive genomic profile of presenting multiple myeloma cases we performed high resolution single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mapping array analysis in 114 samples alongside 258 samples analysed by U133 Plus 2.0 expression array (Affymetrix). We examined DNA copy number alterations and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in order to define the spectrum of minimally deleted regions in which relevant genes of interest can be found. The most frequent deletions are located at 1p (30\%), 6q (33\%), 8p (25\%), 12p (15\%), 13q (59\%), 14q (39\%), 16q (35\%), 17p (7\%), 20 (12\%) and 22 (18\%). In addition, copy number-neutral LOH, or uniparental disomy, was also prevalent on 1q (8\%), 16q (9\%), and X (20\%), and was associated with regions of gain and loss. Based on fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and expression quartile analysis, genes of prognostic importance were found to be located at 1p (FAF1, CDKN2C), 1q (ANP32E), and 17p (TP53). In addition, we identified common homozygously deleted genes which have functions relevant to myeloma biology. Taken together, these analyses indicate that the crucial pathways in myeloma pathogenesis include the NF-kappaB pathway, apoptosis, cell-cycle regulation, Wnt signalling and histone modifications.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), or R-CHOP, has significantly improved the survival of patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. Whether gene-expression signatures correlate with survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is unclear. METHODS: We profiled gene expression in pretreatment biopsy specimens from 181 patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma who received CHOP and 233 patients with this disease who received R-CHOP. A multivariate gene-expression-based survival-predictor model derived from a training group was tested in a validation group. RESULTS: A multivariate model created from three gene-expression signatures--termed "germinal-center B-cell," "stromal-1," and "stromal-2"--predicted survival both in patients who received CHOP and patients who received R-CHOP. The prognostically favorable stromal-1 signature reflected extracellular-matrix deposition and histiocytic infiltration. By contrast, the prognostically unfavorable stromal-2 signature reflected tumor blood-vessel density. CONCLUSIONS: Survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is influenced by differences in immune cells, fibrosis, and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment.},

abstract = {To better define the molecular basis of multiple myeloma (MM), we performed unsupervised hierarchic clustering of mRNA expression profiles in CD138-enriched plasma cells from 414 newly diagnosed patients who went on to receive high-dose therapy and tandem stem cell transplants. Seven disease subtypes were validated that were strongly influenced by known genetic lesions, such as c-MAF- and MAFB-, CCND1- and CCND3-, and MMSET-activating translocations and hyperdiploidy. Indicative of the deregulation of common pathways by gene orthologs, common gene signatures were observed in cases with c-MAF and MAFB activation and CCND1 and CCND3 activation, the latter consisting of 2 subgroups, one characterized by expression of the early B-cell markers CD20 and PAX5. A low incidence of focal bone disease distinguished one and increased expression of proliferation-associated genes of another novel subgroup. Comprising varying fractions of each of the other 6 subgroups, the proliferation subgroup dominated at relapse, suggesting that this signature is linked to disease progression. Proliferation and MMSET-spike groups were characterized by significant overexpression of genes mapping to chromosome 1q, and both exhibited a poor prognosis relative to the other groups. A subset of cases with a predominating myeloid gene expression signature, excluded from the profiling analyses, had more favorable baseline characteristics and superior prognosis to those lacking this signature.},

abstract = {To classify cancer specimens by their gene expression profiles, we created a statistical method based on Bayes' rule that estimates the probability of membership in one of two cancer subgroups. We used this method to classify diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) biopsy samples into two gene expression subgroups based on data obtained from spotted cDNA microarrays. The germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subgroup expressed genes characteristic of normal germinal center B cells whereas the activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL subgroup expressed a subset of the genes that are characteristic of plasma cells, particularly those encoding endoplasmic reticulum and golgi proteins involved in secretion. We next used this predictor to discover these subgroups within a second set of DLBCL biopsies that had been profiled by using oligonucleotide microarrays [Shipp, M. A., et al. (2002) Nat. Med. 8, 68-74]. The GCB and ABC DLBCL subgroups identified in this data set had significantly different 5-yr survival rates after multiagent chemotherapy (62\% vs. 26\%; P < or = 0.0051), in accord with analyses of other DLBCL cohorts. These results demonstrate the ability of this gene expression-based predictor to classify DLBCLs into biologically and clinically distinct subgroups irrespective of the method used to measure gene expression.},

abstract = {Cancer-causing mutations disrupt coordinated, precise programs of gene expression that govern cell growth and differentiation. Microarray-based gene-expression profiling (GEP) is a powerful tool to globally analyze these changes to study cancer biology and clinical behavior. Despite overwhelming genomic chaos in multiple myeloma (MM), expression patterns within tumor samples are remarkably stable and reproducible. Unique expression patterns associated with recurrent chromosomal translocations and ploidy changes defined molecular classes with differing clinical features and outcomes. Combined molecular techniques also dissected two distinct, reproducible forms of hyperdiploid disease and have molecularly defined MM with high risk for poor clinical outcome. GEP is now used to risk-stratify patients with newly diagnosed MM. Groups with high-risk features are evident in all GEP-defined MM classes, and GEP studies of serial samples showed that risk increases over time, with relapsed disease showing dramatic GEP shifts toward a signature of poor outcomes. This suggests a common mechanism of disease evolution and potentially reflects preferential expansion of therapy-resistant cells. Correlating GEP-defined disease class and risk with outcomes of therapeutic regimens reveals class-specific benefits for individual agents, as well as mechanistic insights into drug sensitivity and resistance. Here, we review modern genomics contributions to understanding MM pathogenesis, prognosis, and therapy.},

To investigate whether these DLBCL subtypes arise by distinct pathogenetic mechanisms, we analyzed 203 DLBCL biopsy samples by high-resolution, genome-wide copy number analysis coupled with gene-expression profiling. Of 272 recurrent chromosomal aberrations that were associated with gene-expression alterations, 30 were used differentially by the DLBCL subtypes (P < 0.006). An amplicon on chromosome 19 was detected in 26\% of ABC DLBCLs but in only 3\% of GCB DLBCLs and PMBLs. A highly up-regulated gene in this amplicon was SPIB, which encodes an ETS family transcription factor. Knockdown of SPIB by RNA interference was toxic to ABC DLBCL cell lines but not to GCB DLBCL, PMBL, or myeloma cell lines, strongly implicating SPIB as an oncogene involved in the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL. Deletion of the INK4a/ARF tumor suppressor locus and trisomy 3 also occurred almost exclusively in ABC DLBCLs and was associated with inferior outcome within this subtype. FOXP1 emerged as a potential oncogene in ABC DLBCL that was up-regulated by trisomy 3 and by more focal high-level amplifications. In GCB DLBCL, amplification of the oncogenic mir-17-92 microRNA cluster and deletion of the tumor suppressor PTEN were recurrent, but these events did not occur in ABC DLBCL. Together, these data provide genetic evidence that the DLBCL subtypes are distinct diseases that use different oncogenic pathways.},

Development of a biomarker classifier for high-throughput data involves two components: (i) model building and (ii) performance assessment. This article focuses on feature selection in model building and cross validation for performance assessment. A 'frequency' approach to feature selection is presented and compared to the 'conventional' approach in terms of the predictive accuracy and stability of the selected feature set. The two approaches are compared based on four biomarker classifiers, each with a different feature selection method and well-known classification algorithm. In each of the four classifiers the feature predictor set selected by the frequency approach is more stable than the feature set selected by the conventional approach.},

abstract = {Gene expression profiling of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has revealed distinct molecular subtypes that include germinal center B cell-like (GCB) and activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. ABC DLBCL has a worse survival after upfront chemotherapy and is characterized by constitutive activation of the antiapoptotic nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway, which can inhibit chemotherapy. We hypothesized that inhibition of NF-kappaB might sensitize ABC but not GCB DLBCL to chemotherapy and improve outcome. As the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib can inhibit NF-kappaB through blocking IkappaBalpha degradation, we investigated bortezomib alone followed by bortezomib and doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in recurrent DLBCL. Tumor tissue was analyzed by gene expression profiling and/or immunohistochemistry to identify molecular DLBCL subtypes. As a control, we showed that relapsed/refractory ABC and GCB DLBCL have equally poor survivals after upfront chemotherapy. Bortezomib alone had no activity in DLBCL, but when combined with chemotherapy, it demonstrated a significantly higher response (83\% vs 13\%; P < .001) and median overall survival (10.8 vs 3.4 months; P = .003) in ABC compared with GCB DLBCL, respectively. These results suggest bortezomib enhances the activity of chemotherapy in ABC but not GCB DLBCL, and provide a rational therapeutic approach based on genetically distinct DLBCL subtypes. This trial is registered with http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov under identifier NCT00057902.},

abstract = {In order to identify relevant, molecularly defined subgroups in Multiple Myeloma (MM), gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed on purified CD138+ plasma cells of 320 newly diagnosed myeloma patients included in the Dutch-Belgian/German HOVON-65/ GMMG-HD4 trial using Affymetrix Gene Chip U133 plus 2.0 arrays. Hierarchical clustering identified 10 distinct subgroups, of which six corresponded to clusters described in the UAMS classification, i.e. CD-1 (n=13, 4.1\%), CD-2 (n=34, 10.6\%), MF (n=32, 10.0\%), MS (n=33, 10.3\%), PR (n=15, 4.7\%), and HY (n=77, 24.1\%). Moreover, the UAMS LB cluster was identified as a subcluster of the MF cluster (n=15, 4.7\%). In addition, one subgroup (n=39, 12.2\%) showed a myeloid signature. Three novel subgroups were defined, including a subgroup of 37 patients (11.6\%) characterized by high expression of genes involved in the NFkappaB pathway, which include TNFAIP3 and CD40. Another subgroup of 22 patients (6.9\%) was characterized by distinct overexpression of cancer testis antigens without overexpression of proliferation genes. The third novel cluster of 9 patients (2.8\%) showed upregulation of protein tyrosine phosphatases PRL-3 and PTPRZ1 as well as SOCS3. To conclude, in addition to seven clusters described in the UAMS classification, we identified three novel subsets of MM, which may represent unique diagnostic entities.},

@article{Radmacher2002,
abstract = {We propose a general framework for prediction of predefined tumor classes using gene expression profiles from microarray experiments. The framework consists of 1) evaluating the appropriateness of class prediction for the given data set, 2) selecting the prediction method, 3) performing cross-validated class prediction, and 4) assessing the significance of prediction results by permutation testing. We describe an application of the prediction paradigm to gene expression profiles from human breast cancers, with specimens classified as positive or negative for BRCA1 mutations and also for BRCA2 mutations. In both cases, the accuracy of class prediction was statistically significant when compared to the accuracy of prediction expected by chance. The framework proposed here for the application of class prediction is designed to reduce the occurrence of spurious findings, a legitimate concern for high-dimensional microarray data. The prediction paradigm will serve as a good framework for comparing different prediction methods and may accelerate the development of molecular classifiers that are clinically useful.},

abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is clinically heterogeneous: 40\% of patients respond well to current therapy and have prolonged survival, whereas the remainder succumb to the disease. We proposed that this variability in natural history reflects unrecognized molecular heterogeneity in the tumours. Using DNA microarrays, we have conducted a systematic characterization of gene expression in B-cell malignancies. Here we show that there is diversity in gene expression among the tumours of DLBCL patients, apparently reflecting the variation in tumour proliferation rate, host response and differentiation state of the tumour. We identified two molecularly distinct forms of DLBCL which had gene expression patterns indicative of different stages of B-cell differentiation. One type expressed genes characteristic of germinal centre B cells ('germinal centre B-like DLBCL'); the second type expressed genes normally induced during in vitro activation of peripheral blood B cells ('activated B-like DLBCL'). Patients with germinal centre B-like DLBCL had a significantly better overall survival than those with activated B-like DLBCL. The molecular classification of tumours on the basis of gene expression can thus identify previously undetected and clinically significant subtypes of cancer.},

abstract = {Summary. Estimation of structure, such as in variable selection, graphical modelling or clus- ter analysis, is notoriously difficult, especially for high dimensional data.We introduce stability selection. It is based on subsampling in combination with (high dimensional) selection algo- rithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularization for structure estim- ation. Variable selection and structure estimation improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection is applied.We prove for the randomized lasso that stability selec- tion will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions for consistency of the original lasso method are violated.We demonstrate stability selection for variable selection and Gaussian graphical modelling, using real and simulated data.},

In this study by Hedenfalk et al., the authors attempted to identify discrete gene expression profiles for patients with known hereditary breast cancers caused by mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, both of which increase the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. The genome-wide perspective identified discrete sets of genes that discriminated between BRCA, BRCA2, and sporadic breast tumors. This commentary discusses some limitations of studying a small number of cases. The authors also address the need for validation on independent tumor sets, and the potential benefit of multivariable-type analyses to consider other potential confounding factors such as tumor grade, receptor status, tumor stage, and treatment information.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Hans and coworkers previously developed an immunohistochemical algorithm with approximately 80\% concordance with the gene expression profiling (GEP) classification of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) into the germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtypes. Since then, new antibodies specific to germinal center B-cells have been developed, which might improve the performance of an immunostain algorithm. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We studied 84 cases of cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-vincristine-prednisone (CHOP)-treated DLBCL (47 GCB, 37 ABC) with GCET1, CD10, BCL6, MUM1, FOXP1, BCL2, MTA3, and cyclin D2 immunostains, and compared different combinations of the immunostaining results with the GEP classification. A perturbation analysis was also applied to eliminate the possible effects of interobserver or intraobserver variations. A separate set of 63 DLBCL cases treated with rituximab plus CHOP (37 GCB, 26 ABC) was used to validate the new algorithm. RESULTS: A new algorithm using GCET1, CD10, BCL6, MUM1, and FOXP1 was derived that closely approximated the GEP classification with 93\% concordance. Perturbation analysis indicated that the algorithm was robust within the range of observer variance. The new algorithm predicted 3-year overall survival of the validation set [GCB (87\%) versus ABC (44\%); P < 0.001], simulating the predictive power of the GEP classification. For a group of seven primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, the new algorithm is a better prognostic classifier (all "GCB") than the Hans' algorithm (two GCB, five non-GCB). CONCLUSION: Our new algorithm is significantly more accurate than the Hans' algorithm and will facilitate risk stratification of DLBCL patients and future DLBCL research using archival materials.},

abstract = {Aiming to find key genes and events, we analyze a large data set on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) gene-expression (248 patients, 12196 spots). Applying the loess normalization method on these raw data yields improved survival predictions, in particular for the clinical important group of patients with medium survival time. Furthermore, we identify a simplified prognosis predictor, which stratifies different risk groups similarly well as complex signatures. We identify specific, activated B cell-like (ABC) and germinal center B cell-like (GCB) distinguishing genes. These include early (e.g. CDKN3) and late (e.g. CDKN2C) cell cycle genes. Independently from previous classification by marker genes we confirm a clear binary class distinction between the ABC and GCB subgroups. An earlier suggested third entity is not supported. A key regulatory network, distinguishing marked over-expression in ABC from that in GCB, is built by: ASB13, BCL2, BCL6, BCL7A, CCND2, COL3A1, CTGF, FN1, FOXP1, IGHM, IRF4, LMO2, LRMP, MAPK10, MME, MYBL1, NEIL1 and SH3BP5. It predicts and supports the aggressive behaviour of the ABC subgroup. These results help to understand target interactions, improve subgroup diagnosis, risk prognosis as well as therapy in the ABC and GCB DLBCL subgroups.},

One might expect that the true underlying clusters present in the data differ only with respect to a small fraction of the features, and will be missed if one clusters the observations using the full set of features. We propose a novel framework for sparse clustering, in which one clusters the observations using an adaptively chosen subset of the features. The method uses a lasso-type penalty to select the features. We use this framework to develop simple methods for sparse K-means and sparse hierarchical clustering. A single criterion governs both the selection of the features and the resulting clusters. These approaches are demonstrated on simulated data and on genomic data sets.},

abstract = {Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive malignancy that accounts for nearly 40\% of all lymphoid tumors. This heterogeneous disease can be divided into germinal center B cell-like (GCB) and activated B cell-like (ABC) subtypes by gene expression and immunohistochemical profiling. Using microarray analysis on prototypic cell lines, we identified microRNAs (miR-155, miR-21 and miR-221) that were more highly expressed in ABC-type than GCB-type cell lines. These microRNAs were over-expressed in de novo DLBCL (n = 35), transformed DLBCL (n = 14) and follicular center lymphoma cases (n = 27) compared to normal B cells. Consistent with the cell line model, expression levels were higher in DLBCL cases with an ABC-type immunophenotype than those that were GCB-type (p < 0.05). Moreover, using multivariate analysis we found that expression of miR-21 was an independent prognostic indicator in de novo DLBCL (p < 0.05). Interestingly, expression levels of both miR-155 and miR-21 were also higher in nonmalignant ABC than in GCB cells. As we also demonstrate that expression of microRNAs can be measured reliably from routine paraffin-embedded biopsies of more than 8-years-old (p < 0.001), we suggest that microRNAs could be clinically useful molecular markers for DLBCL as well as other cancers.},

abstract = {For medical classification problems, it is often desirable to have a probability associated with each class. Probabilistic classifiers have received relatively little attention for small n large p classification problems despite of their importance in medical decision making. In this paper, we introduce 2 criteria for assessment of probabilistic classifiers: well-calibratedness and refinement and develop corresponding evaluation measures. We evaluated several published high-dimensional probabilistic classifiers and developed 2 extensions of the Bayesian compound covariate classifier. Based on simulation studies and analysis of gene expression microarray data, we found that proper probabilistic classification is more difficult than deterministic classification. It is important to ensure that a probabilistic classifier is well calibrated or at least not "anticonservative" using the methods developed here. We provide this evaluation for several probabilistic classifiers and also evaluate their refinement as a function of sample size under weak and strong signal conditions. We also present a cross-validation method for evaluating the calibration and refinement of any probabilistic classifier on any data set.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of extremely high-dimensional data, feature selection algorithms have become indispensable components of the learning process. Strangely, despite extensive work on the stability of learning algorithms, the stability of feature selection algorithms has been relatively neglected. This study is an attempt to fill that gap by quantifying the sensitivity of feature selection algorithms to variations in the training set. We assess the stability of feature selection algorithms based on the stability of the feature preferences that they express in the form of weights-scores, ranks, or a selected feature subset. We examine a number of measures to quantify the stability of feature preferences and propose an empirical way to estimate them. We perform a series of experiments with several feature selection algorithms on a set of proteomics datasets. The experiments allow us to explore the merits of each stability measure and create stability profiles of the feature selection algorithms. Finally we show how stability profiles can support the choice of a feature selection algorithm.},

abstract = {The classification of lymphoid malignancies has evolved from a purely morphological scheme to the current WHO (World Health Organization) classification, which takes into consideration histological, immunophenotypic, genetic and clinical information. DNA microarray technology enables the simultaneous determination of the expression levels for thousands of genes (gene expression profile; GEP) and provides a powerful approach for investigating lymphoma biology and improving disease classification. Distinct molecular signatures for many lymphomas, as well as novel lymphoma subtypes have been identified. Molecular prognosticators have also been constructed. Many of the molecular subgroups of lymphoma also show distinct patterns of genetic abnormalities. We also briefly review the application of other genome-wide techniques to the study of lymphomas, such as high resolution array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and next-generation sequencing, and how these technologies will complement each other in improving our understanding of the pathobiology of lymphoma. Specific therapeutic targets will likely emerge from the increased insight into the molecular pathogenesis of the different lymphomas, thus illustrating the utility of these global studies in advancing disease management strategies.},

abstract = {Recent studies have established distinctive serum polypeptide patterns through mass spectrometry (MS) that reportedly correlate with clinically relevant outcomes. Wider acceptance of these signatures as valid biomark- ers for disease may follow sequence characterization of the components and elucidation of the mechanisms by which they are generated. Using a highly optimized peptide extraction and matrix-assisted laser desorp- tion/ionization–time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS–based approach, we now show that a limited subset of serum peptides (a signature) provides accurate class discrimination between patients with 3 types of solid tumors and controls without cancer. Targeted sequence identification of 61 signature peptides revealed that they fall into several tight clusters and that most are generated by exopeptidase activities that confer cancer type–specific differences superimposed on the proteolytic events of the ex vivo coagulation and complement degradation pathways. This small but robust set of marker peptides then enabled highly accurate class predic- tion for an external validation set of prostate cancer samples. In sum, this study provides a direct link between peptide marker profiles of disease and differential protease activity, and the patterns we describe may have clinical utility as surrogate markers for detection and classification of cancer. Our findings also have impor- tant implications for future peptide biomarker discovery efforts.},

abstract = {The emergence of new biological disease markers from mass spectrometric studies of serum proteomes has been quite limited. There are challenges regarding the analytical and statistical procedures, preanalytical variability, and study designs. In this serological study of ovarian cancer, we apply classification methods in a strictly designed study with standardized sample collection procedures. A total of 265 sera from women admitted with symptoms of a pelvic mass were used for model building. We developed a rigorous approach for building classification models suitable for the highly multivariate data and illustrate how to evaluate and ensure data quality and optimize data preprocessing and data reduction. We document time dependent changes in peak profiles up to 15 months after sampling even when storing samples at -20 degrees C. The developed classification model was validated using completely independent samples, and a cross validation procedure which we call cross model validation was applied to get realistic performance values. The best models were able to classify with 79\% specificity and 56\% sensitivity, i.e., an analytical accuracy of 68\%. However, the existing serum marker (CA-125) alone gave a better analytical accuracy (81\%) in the same sample set. Also, the combination of mass spectrometric data and levels of CA-125 data did not improve the predictive performance of models. In conclusion, proteomic approaches to biomarker discovery are not necessarily yielding straightforward diagnostic leads but lay the foundation for more work.},

abstract = {To classify cancer specimens by their gene expression profiles, we created a statistical method based on Bayes' rule that estimates the probability of membership in one of two cancer subgroups. We used this method to classify diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) biopsy samples into two gene expression subgroups based on data obtained from spotted cDNA microarrays. The germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subgroup expressed genes characteristic of normal germinal center B cells whereas the activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL subgroup expressed a subset of the genes that are characteristic of plasma cells, particularly those encoding endoplasmic reticulum and golgi proteins involved in secretion. We next used this predictor to discover these subgroups within a second set of DLBCL biopsies that had been profiled by using oligonucleotide microarrays [Shipp, M. A., et al. (2002) Nat. Med. 8, 68-74]. The GCB and ABC DLBCL subgroups identified in this data set had significantly different 5-yr survival rates after multiagent chemotherapy (62\% vs. 26\%; P < or = 0.0051), in accord with analyses of other DLBCL cohorts. These results demonstrate the ability of this gene expression-based predictor to classify DLBCLs into biologically and clinically distinct subgroups irrespective of the method used to measure gene expression.},

Components of the miRNA machinery and miRNAs themselves are involved in many cellular processes that are altered in cancer, such as differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis. Some miRNAs, referred to as oncomiRs, show differential expression levels in cancer and are able to affect cellular transformation, carcinogenesis and metastasis, acting either as oncogenes or tumour suppressors. The phenomenon of 'oncogene addiction' reveals that despite the multistep nature of tumorigenesis, targeting of certain single oncogenes can have therapeutic value, and the possibility of oncomiR addiction has been proposed but never demonstrated. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a unique miRNA in that it is overexpressed in most tumour types analysed so far. Despite great interest in miR-21, most of the data implicating it in cancer have been obtained through miRNA profiling and limited in vitro functional assays. To explore the role of miR-21 in cancer in vivo, we used Cre and Tet-off technologies to generate mice conditionally expressing miR-21. Here we show that overexpression of miR-21 leads to a pre-B malignant lymphoid-like phenotype, demonstrating that mir-21 is a genuine oncogene. When miR-21 was inactivated, the tumours regressed completely in a few days, partly as a result of apoptosis.

Here, we describe high-throughput murine leukemia virus insertional mutagenesis screens in mice that are deficient for one or two CDK inhibitors. We retrieved 9,117 retroviral insertions from 476 lymphomas to define hundreds of loci that are mutated more frequently than expected by chance. Many of these loci are skewed toward a specific genetic context of predisposing germline and somatic mutations. We also found associations between these loci with gender, age of tumor onset, and lymphocyte lineage (B or T cell). Comparison of retroviral insertion sites with single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia revealed a significant overlap between the datasets. Together, our findings highlight the importance of genetic context within large-scale mutation detection studies, and they show a novel use for insertional mutagenesis data in prioritizing disease-associated genes that emerge from genome-wide association studies.},

We use this pilot study to report on the feasibility of exon array implementation looking to replace the 3' in vitro transcription expression arrays in our laboratory.One of the most widely studied models of cellular response is T-cell activation from exogenous stimulation. Microarray studies have contributed to our understanding of key pathways activated during T-cell stimulation.

abstract = {The consistency of peripheral gene expression data and the overlap with brain expression has not been evaluated in biomarker discovery, nor has it been reported in multiple tissues from the same subjects on a genome wide transcript level. The effects of processing whole blood, transformation, and passaged cell lines on gene expression profiling was studied in healthy subjects using Affymetrix arrays. Ficoll extracted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphocytes, passaged lymphoblastic cell lines (LCLs), and whole blood from Tempus tubes were compared. There were 6,813 transcripts differentially expressed between different methods of blood preparation. Principal component analysis resolved two partitions involving pre- and post-transformation EBV effects. Combining results from Affymetrix arrays, postmortem subjects' brain and PBMC profiles showed co-expression levels of summarized transcripts for 4,103 of 17,859 (22.9\%) RefSeq transcripts. In a control experiment, rat hemi-brain and blood showed similar expression levels for 19\% of RefSeq transcripts. After filtering transcripts that were not significantly different in abundance between human cerebellum and PBMCs from the Affymetrix exon array the correlation in mean transcript abundance was high as expected (r = 0.98). Differences in the alternative splicing index in brain and blood were found for about 90\% of all transcripts examined. This study demonstrates over 4,100 brain transcripts co-expressed in blood samples can be further examined by in vitro and in vivo experimental studies of blood and cell lines from patients with psychiatric disorders.},

abstract = {We propose a fast and powerful analysis algorithm, titled Model-based Analysis of Tiling-arrays (MAT), to reliably detect regions enriched by transcription factor chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) on Affymetrix tiling arrays (ChIP-chip). MAT models the baseline probe behavior by considering probe sequence and copy number on each array. It standardizes the probe value through the probe model, eliminating the need for sample normalization. MAT uses an innovative function to score regions for ChIP enrichment, which allows robust P value and false discovery rate calculations. MAT can detect ChIP regions from a single ChIP sample, multiple ChIP samples, or multiple ChIP samples with controls with increasing accuracy. The single-array ChIP region detection feature minimizes the time and monetary costs for laboratories newly adopting ChIP-chip to test their protocols and antibodies and allows established ChIP-chip laboratories to identify samples with questionable quality that might contaminate their data. MAT is developed in open-source Python and is available at http://chip.dfci.harvard.edu/ approximately wli/MAT. The general framework presented here can be extended to other oligonucleotide microarrays and tiling array platforms.},

A variety of splicing prediction methods has been proposed for Affymetrix exon arrays mainly focusing on geometric correlation measures or analysis of variance. In this article, we introduce an information theoretic concept that is based on modification of the well-known entropy function. RESULTS: We have developed an AS robust prediction method based on entropy (ARH). We can show that this measure copes with bias inherent in the analysis of AS such as the dependency of prediction performance on the number of exons or variable exon expression. In order to judge the performance of ARH, we have compared it with eight existing splicing prediction methods using experimental benchmark data and demonstrate that ARH is a well-performing new method for the prediction of splice variants.

We show this B cell-to-PC differentiation to involve IRF4 and AICDA expressions in D4 activated B cells, decrease of PAX5 and BCL6 expressions, and increase in PRDM1 and XBP1 expressions in D7 plasmablasts and D10 PCs. It involves down-regulation of genes controlled by Pax5 and induction of genes controlled by Blimp-1 and XBP1 (unfold protein response). The detailed phenotype of D10 PCs resembles that of peripheral blood PCs detected after immunization of healthy donors. This in vitro model will facilitate further studies in PC biology. It will likewise be helpful to study PC dyscrasias, including multiple myeloma.},

abstract = {The identification of alternatively spliced transcript variants specific to particular biological processes in tumours should increase our understanding of cancer. Hypoxia is an important factor in cancer biology, and associated splice variants may present new markers to help with planning treatment. A method was developed to analyse alternative splicing in exon array data, using probeset multiplicity to identify genes with changes in expression across their loci, and a combination of the splicing index and a new metric based on the variation of reliability weighted fold changes to detect changes in the splicing patterns. The approach was validated on a cancer/normal sample dataset in which alternative splicing events had been confirmed using RT-PCR. We then analysed ten head and neck squamous cell carcinomas using exon arrays and identified differentially expressed splice variants in five samples with high versus five with low levels of hypoxia-associated genes. The analysis identified a splice variant of LAMA3 (Laminin alpha 3), LAMA3-A, known to be involved in tumour cell invasion and progression. The full-length transcript of the gene (LAMA3-B) did not appear to be hypoxia-associated. The results were confirmed using qualitative RT-PCR. In a series of 59 prospectively collected head and neck tumours, expression of LAMA3-A had prognostic significance whereas LAMA3-B did not. This work illustrates the potential for alternatively spliced transcripts to act as biomarkers of disease prognosis with improved specificity for particular tissues or conditions over assays which do not discriminate between splice variants.},

abstract = {One of the main objectives in the analysis of microarray experiments is the identification of genes that are differentially expressed under two experimental conditions. This task is complicated by the noisiness of the data and the large number of genes that are examined simultaneously. Here, we present a novel technique for identifying differentially expressed genes that does not originate from a sophisticated statistical model but rather from an analysis of biological reasoning. The new technique, which is based on calculating rank products (RP) from replicate experiments, is fast and simple. At the same time, it provides a straightforward and statistically stringent way to determine the significance level for each gene and allows for the flexible control of the false-detection rate and familywise error rate in the multiple testing situation of a microarray experiment. We use the RP technique on three biological data sets and show that in each case it performs more reliably and consistently than the non-parametric t-test variant implemented in Tusher et al.'s significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). We also show that the RP results are reliable in highly noisy data. An analysis of the physiological function of the identified genes indicates that the RP approach is powerful for identifying biologically relevant expression changes. In addition, using RP can lead to a sharp reduction in the number of replicate experiments needed to obtain reproducible results.},

To measure tissue-specific splicing of genes on a large scale, we collected gene expression data from 11 rat tissues using a high-density oligonucleotide array representing 1600 rat genes. Expression of each gene on the chip is measured by 20 pairs of independent oligonucleotide probes. Two algorithms have been developed to normalize and compare the chip hybridization signals among different tissues at individual oligonucleotide probe level. Oligonucleotide probes (the perfect match [PM] probe of each probe pair), detecting potential tissue-specific splice variants, were identified by the algorithms. The identified candidate splice variants have been compared to the alternatively spliced transcripts predicted by an EST clustering program. In addition, 50\% of the top candidates predicted by the algorithms were confirmed by RT-PCR experiment. The study indicates that oligonucleotide probe-based DNA chip assays provide a powerful approach to detect splice variants at genome scale.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative splicing is a mechanism for increasing protein diversity by excluding or including exons during post-transcriptional processing. Alternatively spliced proteins are particularly relevant in oncology since they may contribute to the etiology of cancer, provide selective drug targets, or serve as a marker set for cancer diagnosis. While conventional identification of splice variants generally targets individual genes, we present here a new exon-centric array (GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST) that allows genome-wide identification of differential splice variation, and concurrently provides a flexible and inclusive analysis of gene expression. RESULTS: We analyzed 20 paired tumor-normal colon cancer samples using a microarray designed to detect over one million putative exons that can be virtually assembled into potential gene-level transcripts according to various levels of prior supporting evidence. Analysis of high confidence (empirically supported) transcripts identified 160 differentially expressed genes, with 42 genes occupying a network impacting cell proliferation and another twenty nine genes with unknown functions. A more speculative analysis, including transcripts based solely on computational prediction, produced another 160 differentially expressed genes, three-fourths of which have no previous annotation. We also present a comparison of gene signal estimations from the Exon 1.0 ST and the U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. Novel splicing events were predicted by experimental algorithms that compare the relative contribution of each exon to the cognate transcript intensity in each tissue. The resulting candidate splice variants were validated with RT-PCR. We found nine genes that were differentially spliced between colon tumors and normal colon tissues, several of which have not been previously implicated in cancer. Top scoring candidates from our analysis were also found to substantially overlap with EST-based bioinformatic predictions of alternative splicing in cancer. CONCLUSION: Differential expression of high confidence transcripts correlated extremely well with known cancer genes and pathways, suggesting that the more speculative transcripts, largely based solely on computational prediction and mostly with no previous annotation, might be novel targets in colon cancer. Five of the identified splicing events affect mediators of cytoskeletal organization (ACTN1, VCL, CALD1, CTTN, TPM1), two affect extracellular matrix proteins (FN1, COL6A3) and another participates in integrin signaling (SLC3A2). Altogether they form a pattern of colon-cancer specific alterations that may particularly impact cell motility.},

In this article, we have analyzed exon array data from many different human and mouse tissues and have uncovered a systematic relationship between transcript-fold change and alternative splicing as reported by the splicing index. Evidence from dilution experiments and deep sequencing suggest that this effect is of technical rather than biological origin and that it is driven by sequence features of the probes. This effect is substantial and results in a 12-fold overestimation of alternative splicing events in genes that are differentially expressed. By cross-species exon array comparison, we could further show that the systematic bias persists even across species boundaries. Failure to consider this effect in data analysis would result in the reproducible false detection of apparently conserved alternative splicing events. Finally, we have developed a software in R called COSIE (Corrected Splicing Indices for Exon arrays) that for any given set of new exon array experiments corrects for the observed bias and improves the detection of alternative splicing (available at www.fmi.ch/groups/gbioinfo).},

abstract = {With the availability of the Affymetrix exon arrays a number of tools have been developed to enable the analysis. These however can be expensive or have several pre-installation requirements. This led us to develop an analysis workflow for analysing differential splicing using freely available software packages that are already being widely used for gene expression analysis. The workflow uses the packages in the standard installation of R and Bioconductor (BiocLite) to identify differential splicing. We use the splice index method with the LIMMA framework. The main drawback with this approach is that it relies on accurate estimates of gene expression from the probe-level data. Methods such as RMA and PLIER may misestimate when a large proportion of exons are spliced. We therefore present the novel concept of a gene correlation coefficient calculated using only the probeset expression pattern within a gene. We show that genes with lower correlation coefficients are likely to be differentially spliced.},

abstract = {Alternative splicing has recently emerged as a major mechanism of regulation in the human genome, occurring in perhaps 40-60\% of human genes. Thus, microarray studies of functional regulation could, in principle, be extended to detect not only the changes in the overall expression of a gene, but also changes in its splicing pattern between different tissues. However, since changes in the total expression of a gene and changes in its alternative splicing can be mixed in complex ways among a set of samples, separating these effects can be difficult, and is essential for their accurate assessment. We present a simple and general approach for distinguishing changes in alternative splicing from changes in expression, based on detecting systematic anti-correlation between the log-ratios of two different samples versus a pool containing both samples. We have tested this analysis method on microarray data for five human tissues, generated using a standard microarray platform and experimental protocols shown previously to be sensitive to alternative splicing. Our automatic analysis was able to detect a wide variety of tissue-specific alternative splicing events, such as exon skipping,mutually exclusive exons, alternative 3' and alternative 5' splicing, alternative initiation and alternative termination, all of which were validated by independent reverse-transcriptase PCR experiments, with validation rates of 70-85\%. Our analysis method also enables hierarchical clustering of genes and samples by the level of similarity to their alternative splicing patterns, revealing patterns of tissue-specific regulation that are distinct from those obtained by hierarchical clustering of gene expression from the same microarray data. Our data and analysis source code are available from http://www.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/ASAP.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic cells are endowed with very specific biological functions, including cell motility and immune response. These specific functions are dramatically altered during hematopoietic cell differentiation, whereby undifferentiated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) residing in bone marrow differentiate into platelets, red blood cells and immune cells that exit into the blood stream and eventually move into lymphoid organs or inflamed tissues. The contribution of alternative splicing (AS) to these functions has long been minimized due to incomplete knowledge on AS events in hematopoietic cells. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using Human Exon ST 1.0 microarrays, the entire exome expression profile of immature CD34+ HSPC and mature whole blood cells was mapped, compared to a collection of solid tissues and made freely available as an online exome expression atlas (Amazonia Exon! : http://amazonia.transcriptome.eu/exon.php). At a whole transcript level, HSPC strongly expressed EREG and the pluripotency marker DPPA4. Using a differential splicing index scheme (dsi), a list of 849 transcripts differentially expressed between hematopoietic cells and solid tissues was computed, that included NEDD9 and CD74. Some of these genes also underwent alternative splicing events during hematopoietic differentiation, such as INPP4B, PTPLA or COMMD6, with varied contribution of CD3+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD14+ or CD15+ myelomonocytic populations. Strikingly, these genes were significantly enriched for genes involved in cell motility, cell adhesion, response to wounding and immune processes. CONCLUSION: The relevance and the precision provided by this exon expression map highlights the contribution of alternative splicing to key feature of blood cells differentiation and function.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The latest generation of Affymetrix microarrays are designed to interrogate expression over the entire length of every locus, thus giving the opportunity to study alternative splicing genome-wide. The Exon 1.0 ST (sense target) platform, with versions for Human, Mouse and Rat, is designed primarily to probe every known or predicted exon. The smaller Gene 1.0 ST array is designed as an expression microarray but still interrogates expression with probes along the full length of each well-characterized transcript. We explore the possibility of using the Gene 1.0 ST platform to identify differential splicing events. RESULTS: We propose a strategy to score differential splicing by using the auxiliary information from fitting the statistical model, RMA (robust multichip analysis). RMA partitions the probe-level data into probe effects and expression levels, operating robustly so that if a small number of probes behave differently than the rest, they are downweighted in the fitting step. We argue that adjacent poorly fitting probes for a given sample can be evidence of differential splicing and have designed a statistic to search for this behaviour. Using a public tissue panel dataset, we show many examples of tissue-specific alternative splicing. Furthermore, we show that evidence for putative alternative splicing has a strong correspondence between the Gene 1.0 ST and Exon 1.0 ST platforms. CONCLUSION: We propose a new approach, FIRMAGene, to search for differentially spliced genes using the Gene 1.0 ST platform. Such an analysis complements the search for differential expression. We validate the method by illustrating several known examples and we note some of the challenges in interpreting the probe-level data.Software implementing our methods is freely available as an R package.},

The analysis of such experiments is nontrivial because of large data size and many levels of variation introduced at different stages of the experiments. The analysis is further complicated by the large differences that may exist among different probes used to interrogate the same gene. However, an attractive feature of high-density oligonucleotide arrays such as those produced by photolithography and inkjet technology is the standardization of chip manufacturing and hybridization process. As a result, probe-specific biases, although significant, are highly reproducible and predictable, and their adverse effect can be reduced by proper modeling and analysis methods. Here, we propose a statistical model for the probe-level data, and develop model-based estimates for gene expression indexes. We also present model-based methods for identifying and handling cross-hybridizing probes and contaminating array regions. Applications of these results will be presented elsewhere.},

After accommodating changes in transcription and decay by using gene-specific indexes, functional relationships between mRNA processing factors can be identified through their common effects on spliced and unspliced RNA. Groups of genes with different dependencies on mRNA processing factors are also apparent.

We hypothesized that differences in exon expression and splicing might be useful for pathophysiology and diagnosis. To demonstrate exon expression and alternatively spliced gene differences in blood of individuals with TS compared to healthy controls (HC), RNA was isolated from the blood of 26 un-medicated TS subjects and 23 HC. Each sample was run on Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST (HuExon) arrays and on 3' biased U133 Plus 2.0 (HuU133) arrays. To investigate the differentially expressed exons and transcripts, analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were performed, controlling for age, gender, and batch. Differential alternative splicing patterns between TS and HC were identified using analyses of variance (ANOVA) models in Partek. Three hundred and seventy-six exon probe sets were differentially expressed between TS and HC (raw P < 0.005, fold change >|1.2|) that separated TS and HC subjects using hierarchical clustering and Principal Components Analysis. The probe sets predicted TS compared to HC with a >90\% sensitivity and specificity using a 10-fold cross-validation. Ninety genes (transcripts) had differential expression of a single exon (raw P < 0.005) and were predicted to be alternatively spliced (raw P < 0.05) in TS compared to HC. These preliminary findings might provide insight into the pathophysiology of TS and potentially provide prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers. However, the findings are tempered by the small sample size and multiple comparisons and require confirmation using PCR or deep RNA sequencing and a much larger patient population.},

RESULTS: We present a method, finding isoforms using robust multichip analysis (FIRMA), for detecting differential alternative splicing in exon array data. FIRMA has been developed for Affymetrix exon arrays, but could in principle be extended to other exon arrays, tiling arrays or splice junction arrays. We have evaluated the method using simulated data, and have also applied it to two datasets: a panel of 11 human tissues and a set of 10 pairs of matched normal and tumor colon tissue. FIRMA is able to detect exons in several genes confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR. AVAILABILITY: R code implementing our methods is contributed to the package aroma.affymetrix.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Alternative splicing (AS) is a frequent step in metozoan gene expression whereby the exons of genes are spliced in different combinations to generate multiple isoforms of mature mRNA. AS functions to enrich an organism's proteomic complexity and regulates gene expression. Despite its importance, the mechanisms underlying AS and its regulation are not well understood, especially in the context of global gene expression patterns. We present here an algorithm referred to as the Generative model for the Alternative Splicing Array Platform (GenASAP) that can predict the levels of AS for thousands of exon skipping events using data generated from custom microarrays. GenASAP uses Bayesian learning in an unsupervised probability model to accurately predict AS levels from the microarray data. GenASAP is capable of learning the hybridization profiles of microarray data, while modeling noise processes and missing or aberrant data. GenASAP has been successfully applied to the global discovery and analysis of AS in mammalian cells and tissues. RESULTS: GenASAP was applied to data obtained from a custom microarray designed for the monitoring of 3126 AS events in mouse cells and tissues. The microarray design included probes specific for exon body and junction sequences formed by the splicing of exons. Our results show that GenASAP provides accurate predictions for over one-third of the total events, as verified by independent RT-PCR assays.

abstract = {Splicing and alternative splicing are major processes in the interpretation and expression of genetic information for metazoan organisms. The study of splicing is moving from focused attention on the regulatory mechanisms of a selected set of paradigmatic alternative splicing events to questions of global integration of splicing regulation with genome and cell function. For this reason, parallel methods for detecting and measuring alternative splicing are necessary. We have adapted the splicing-sensitive oligonucleotide microarrays used to estimate splicing efficiency in yeast to the study of alternative splicing in vertebrate cells and tissues. We use gene models incorporating knowledge about splicing to design oligonucleotides specific for discriminating alternatively spliced mRNAs from each other. Here we present the main strategies for design, application, and analysis of spotted oligonucleotide arrays for detection and measurement of alternative splicing. We demonstrate these strategies using a two-intron yeast gene that has been altered to produce different amounts of alternatively spliced RNAs, as well as by profiling alternative splicing in NCI 60 cancer cell lines.},

@article{Ha2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emergence of isoform-sensitive microarrays has helped fuel in-depth studies of the human transcriptome. The Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Array (Exon Array) has been previously shown to be effective in profiling gene expression at the isoform level. More recently, the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Gene 1.0 ST Array (Gene Array) has been released for measuring gene expression and interestingly contains a large subset of probes from the Exon Array. Here, we explore the potential of using Gene Array probes to assess expression variation at the sub-transcript level. Utilizing datasets of the high quality Microarray Quality Control (MAQC) RNA samples previously assayed on the Exon Array and Gene Array, we compare the expression measurements of the two platforms to determine the performance of the Gene Array in detecting isoform variations. RESULTS: Overall, we show that the Gene Array is comparable to the Exon Array in making gene expression calls. Moreover, to examine expression of different isoforms, we modify the Gene Array probe set definition file to enable summarization of probe intensity values at the exon level and show that the expression profiles between the two platforms are also highly correlated. Next, expression calls of previously known differentially spliced genes were compared and also show concordant results. Splicing index analysis, representing estimates of exon inclusion levels, shows a lower but good correlation between platforms. As the Gene Array contains a significant subset of probes from the Exon Array, we note that, in comparison, the Gene Array overlaps with fewer but still a high proportion of splicing events annotated in the Known Alt Events UCSC track, with abundant coverage of cassette exons. We discuss the ability of the Gene Array to detect alternative splicing and isoform variation and address its limitations. CONCLUSION: The Gene Array is an effective expression profiling tool at gene and exon expression level, the latter made possible by probe set annotation modifications. We demonstrate that the Gene Array is capable of detecting alternative splicing and isoform variation. As expected, in comparison to the Exon Array, it is limited by reduced gene content coverage and is not able to detect as wide a range of alternative splicing events. However, for the events that can be monitored by both platforms, we estimate that the selectivity and sensitivity levels are comparable. We hope our findings will shed light on the potential extension of the Gene Array to detect alternative splicing. It should be particularly suitable for researchers primarily interested in gene expression analysis, but who may be willing to look for splicing and isoform differences within their dataset. However, we do not suggest it to be an equivalent substitute to the more comprehensive Exon Array.},

Whether gene-expression signatures correlate with survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is unclear. METHODS: We profiled gene expression in pretreatment biopsy specimens from 181 patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma who received CHOP and 233 patients with this disease who received R-CHOP. A multivariate gene-expression-based survival-predictor model derived from a training group was tested in a validation group. RESULTS: A multivariate model created from three gene-expression signatures--termed "germinal-center B-cell," "stromal-1," and "stromal-2"--predicted survival both in patients who received CHOP and patients who received R-CHOP. The prognostically favorable stromal-1 signature reflected extracellular-matrix deposition and histiocytic infiltration. By contrast, the prognostically unfavorable stromal-2 signature reflected tumor blood-vessel density. CONCLUSIONS: Survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is influenced by differences in immune cells, fibrosis, and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to develop pharmacogenomic predictors in response to standard chemotherapy drugs in breast cancer cell lines and test their predictive value in patients who received treatment with the same drugs. Nineteen human breast cancer cell lines were tested for sensitivity to paclitaxel (T), 5-fluorouracil (F), doxorubicin (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) in vitro. Baseline gene expression data were obtained for each cell line with Affymetrix U133A gene chips, and multigene predictors of sensitivity were derived for each drug separately. These predictors were applied individually and in combination to human gene expression data generated with the same Affymetrix platform from fine needle aspiration specimens of 133 stage I-III breast cancers. Tumor samples were obtained at baseline, and each patient received 6 months of preoperative TFAC chemotherapy followed by surgery. Cell line-derived prediction results were correlated with the observed pathologic response to chemotherapy. Statistically robust differentially expressed genes between sensitive and resistant cells could only be found for paclitaxel. False discovery rates associated with the informative genes were high for all other drugs. For each drug, the top 100 differentially expressed genes were combined into a drug-specific response predictor. When these cell line-based predictors were applied to patient data, there was no significant correlation between observed response and predicted response either for individual drug predictors or combined predictions. Cell line-derived predictors of response to four commonly used chemotherapy drugs did not predict response accurately in patients.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Several different multivariate prediction models using routine clinical variables or multigene signatures have been proposed to predict pathologic complete response to combination chemotherapy in breast cancer. Our goal was to compare the performance of four conceptually different predictors in an independent cohort of patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression profiling was done on fine-needle aspirations of 100 stage I to III breast cancers before preoperative paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide combination chemotherapy. Pathologic response was correlated with prediction results from a clinical nomogram, a human cancer-derived genomic predictor (DLDA30), a cell line-based genomic predictor [in vitro coexpression extrapolation (COXEN)], and an optimized cell line-derived (in vivo COXEN) predictor. None of the 100 test cases were used in the development of these predictors. RESULTS: The in vitro COXEN using a combination of four individual drug sensitivity predictions derived from cell lines was not predictive [area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), 0.5; 95\% confidence interval, (95\% CI), 0.41-0.59]. The clinical nomogram (AUC, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.65-0.80) and the DLDA30 (AUC, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.80) genomic predictor had similar performances. The in vivo COXEN that used informative genes from cell lines but was trained on a separate human data set also showed significant predictive value (AUC, 0.67; 95\% CI, 0.60-0.74). These three different prediction scores correlated with each other and were significant in univariate but not in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Three conceptually different predictors performed similarly in this validation study and tended to identify the same patients as responders. A genomic predictor that relied solely on a composite of individual drug sensitivity predictions from cell lines did not show any predictive value.},

abstract = {The choice of therapy for metastatic cancer is largely empirical because of a lack of chemosensitivity prediction for available combination chemotherapeutic regimens. Here, we identify molecular models of bladder carcinoma chemosensitivity based on gene expression for three widely used chemotherapeutic agents: cisplatin, paclitaxel, and gemcitabine. We measured the growth inhibition elicited by these three agents in a series of 40 human urothelial cancer cell lines and correlated the GI(50) (50\% of growth inhibition) values with quantitative measures of global gene expression to derive models of chemosensitivity using a misclassification-penalized posterior approach. The misclassification-penalized posterior-derived models predicted the growth response of human bladder cancer cell lines to each of the three agents with sensitivities of between 0.93 and 0.96. We then developed an in silico approach to predict the cellular growth responses for each of these agents in the clinically relevant two-agent combinations. These predictions were prospectively evaluated on a series of 15 randomly chosen bladder carcinoma cell lines. Overall, 80\% of the predicted combinations were correct (P = 0.0002). Together, our results suggest that chemosensitivity to drug combinations can be predicted based on molecular models and provide the framework for evaluation of such models in patients undergoing combination chemotherapy for cancer. If validated in vivo, such predictive models have the potential to guide therapeutic choice at the level of an individual's tumor.},

abstract = {The U.S. National Cancer Institute has used a panel of 60 diverse human cancer cell lines (the NCI-60) to screen >100,000 chemical compounds for anticancer activity. However, not all important cancer types are included in the panel, nor are drug responses of the panel predictive of clinical efficacy in patients. We asked, therefore, whether it would be possible to extrapolate from that rich database (or analogous ones from other drug screens) to predict activity in cell types not included or, for that matter, clinical responses in patients with tumors. We address that challenge by developing and applying an algorithm we term "coexpression extrapolation" (COXEN). COXEN uses expression microarray data as a Rosetta Stone for translating from drug activities in the NCI-60 to drug activities in any other cell panel or set of clinical tumors. Here, we show that COXEN can accurately predict drug sensitivity of bladder cancer cell lines and clinical responses of breast cancer patients treated with commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, we used COXEN for in silico screening of 45,545 compounds and identify an agent with activity against human bladder cancer.},

abstract = {Gene co-expression network analysis is an effective method for predicting gene functions and disease biomarkers. However, few studies have systematically identified co-expressed genes involved in the molecular origin and development of various types of tumors. In this study, we used a network mining algorithm to identify tightly connected gene co-expression networks that are frequently present in microarray datasets from 33 types of cancer which were derived from 16 organs/tissues. We compared the results with networks found in multiple normal tissue types and discovered 18 tightly connected frequent networks in cancers, with highly enriched functions on cancer-related activities. Most networks identified also formed physically interacting networks. In contrast, only 6 networks were found in normal tissues, which were highly enriched for housekeeping functions. The largest cancer network contained many genes with genome stability maintenance functions. We tested 13 selected genes from this network for their involvement in genome maintenance using two cell-based assays. Among them, 10 were shown to be involved in either homology-directed DNA repair or centrosome duplication control including the well- known cancer marker MKI67. Our results suggest that the commonly recognized characteristics of cancers are supported by highly coordinated transcriptomic activities. This study also demonstrated that the co-expression network directed approach provides a powerful tool for understanding cancer physiology, predicting new gene functions, as well as providing new target candidates for cancer therapeutics.},

abstract = {BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor required for mature B-cell germinal center (GC) formation and implicated in lymphomagenesis. BCL6's physiologic function is only partially known because the complete set of its targets in GC B cells has not been identified. To address this issue, we used an integrated biochemical-computational-functional approach to identify BCL6 direct targets in normal GC B cells. This approach includes (1) identification of BCL6-bound promoters by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, (2) inference of transcriptional relationships by the use of a regulatory network reverse engineering approach (ARACNe), and (3) validation of physiologic relevance of the candidate targets down-regulated in GC B cells. Our approach demonstrated that a large set of promoters (> 4000) is physically bound by BCL6 but that only a fraction of them is repressed in GC B cells. This set of 1207 targets identifies several cellular functions directly controlled by BCL6 during GC development, including activation, survival, DNA-damage response, cell cycle arrest, cytokine signaling, Toll-like receptor signaling, and differentiation. These results define a broad role of BCL6 in preventing centroblasts from responding to signals leading to exit from the GC before they complete the phase of proliferative expansion and of antibody affinity maturation.},

abstract = {Gene expression profiling of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has revealed distinct molecular subtypes that include germinal center B cell-like (GCB) and activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL. ABC DLBCL has a worse survival after upfront chemotherapy and is characterized by constitutive activation of the antiapoptotic nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) pathway, which can inhibit chemotherapy. We hypothesized that inhibition of NF-kappaB might sensitize ABC but not GCB DLBCL to chemotherapy and improve outcome. As the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib can inhibit NF-kappaB through blocking IkappaBalpha degradation, we investigated bortezomib alone followed by bortezomib and doxorubicin-based chemotherapy in recurrent DLBCL. Tumor tissue was analyzed by gene expression profiling and/or immunohistochemistry to identify molecular DLBCL subtypes. As a control, we showed that relapsed/refractory ABC and GCB DLBCL have equally poor survivals after upfront chemotherapy. Bortezomib alone had no activity in DLBCL, but when combined with chemotherapy, it demonstrated a significantly higher response (83\% vs 13\%; P < .001) and median overall survival (10.8 vs 3.4 months; P = .003) in ABC compared with GCB DLBCL, respectively. These results suggest bortezomib enhances the activity of chemotherapy in ABC but not GCB DLBCL, and provide a rational therapeutic approach based on genetically distinct DLBCL subtypes.

abstract = {Classification using high-dimensional features arises frequently in many contemporary statistical studies such as tumor classification using microarray or other high-throughput data. The impact of dimensionality on classifications is largely poorly understood. In a seminal paper, Bickel and Levina (2004) show that the Fisher discriminant performs poorly due to diverging spectra and they propose to use the independence rule to overcome the problem. We first demonstrate that even for the independence classification rule, classification using all the features can be as bad as the random guessing due to noise accumulation in estimating population centroids in high-dimensional feature space. In fact, we demonstrate further that almost all linear discriminants can perform as bad as the random guessing. Thus, it is paramountly important to select a subset of important features for high-dimensional classification, resulting in Features Annealed Independence Rules (FAIR). The conditions under which all the important features can be selected by the two-sample t-statistic are established. The choice of the optimal number of features, or equivalently, the threshold value of the test statistics are proposed based on an upper bound of the classification error. Simulation studies and real data analysis support our theoretical results and demonstrate convincingly the advantage of our new classification procedure.},

abstract = {Microarray gene-expression data of 54 paired gastric cancer and adjacent noncancerous gastric tissues were analyzed, with the aim to establish gene signatures for cancer grades (well-, moderately-, poorly- or un-differentiated) and stages (I, II, III and IV), which have been determined by pathologists. Our statistical analysis led to the identification of a number of gene combinations whose expression patterns serve well as signatures of different grades and different stages of gastric cancer. A 19-gene signature was found to have discerning power between high- and low-grade gastric cancers in general, with overall classification accuracy at 79.6\%. An expanded 198-gene panel allows the stratification of cancers into four grades and control, giving rise to an overall classification agreement of 74.2\% between each grade designated by the pathologists and our prediction. Two signatures for cancer staging, consisting of 10 genes and 9 genes, respectively, provide high classification accuracies at 90.0\% and 84.0\%, among early-, advanced-stage cancer and control. Functional and pathway analyses on these signature genes reveal the significant relevance of the derived signatures to cancer grades and progression. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first study on identification of genes whose expression patterns can serve as markers for cancer grades and stages.},

abstract = {Gene expression profiling (GEP) has stratified diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) into molecular subgroups that correspond to different stages of lymphocyte development-namely germinal center B-cell like and activated B-cell like. This classification has prognostic significance, but GEP is expensive and not readily applicable into daily practice, which has lead to immunohistochemical algorithms proposed as a surrogate for GEP analysis. We assembled tissue microarrays from 475 de novo DLBCL patients who were treated with rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy. All cases were successfully profiled by GEP on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Sections were stained with antibodies reactive with CD10, GCET1, FOXP1, MUM1 and BCL6 and cases were classified following a rationale of sequential steps of differentiation of B cells. Cutoffs for each marker were obtained using receiver-operating characteristic curves, obviating the need for any arbitrary method. An algorithm based on the expression of CD10, FOXP1 and BCL6 was developed that had a simpler structure than other recently proposed algorithms and 92.6\% concordance with GEP. In multivariate analysis, both the International Prognostic Index and our proposed algorithm were significant independent predictors of progression-free and overall survival. In conclusion, this algorithm effectively predicts prognosis of DLBCL patients matching GEP subgroups in the era of rituximab therapy.},

abstract = {In important application fields today-genomics and proteomics are examples-selecting a small subset of useful features is crucial for success of Linear Classification Analysis. We study feature selection by thresholding of feature Z-scores and introduce a principle of threshold selection, based on the notion of higher criticism (HC). For i = 1, 2, ..., p, let pi(i) denote the two-sided P-value associated with the ith feature Z-score and pi((i)) denote the ith order statistic of the collection of P-values. The HC threshold is the absolute Z-score corresponding to the P-value maximizing the HC objective (i/p - pi((i)))/sqrt\{i/p(1-i/p)\}. We consider a rare/weak (RW) feature model, where the fraction of useful features is small and the useful features are each too weak to be of much use on their own. HC thresholding (HCT) has interesting behavior in this setting, with an intimate link between maximizing the HC objective and minimizing the error rate of the designed classifier, and very different behavior from popular threshold selection procedures such as false discovery rate thresholding (FDRT). In the most challenging RW settings, HCT uses an unconventionally low threshold; this keeps the missed-feature detection rate under better control than FDRT and yields a classifier with improved misclassification performance. Replacing cross-validated threshold selection in the popular Shrunken Centroid classifier with the computationally less expensive and simpler HCT reduces the variance of the selected threshold and the error rate of the constructed classifier. Results on standard real datasets and in asymptotic theory confirm the advantages of HCT.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The addition of rituximab to combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), or R-CHOP, has significantly improved the survival of patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma. Whether gene-expression signatures correlate with survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is unclear. METHODS: We profiled gene expression in pretreatment biopsy specimens from 181 patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma who received CHOP and 233 patients with this disease who received R-CHOP. A multivariate gene-expression-based survival-predictor model derived from a training group was tested in a validation group. RESULTS: A multivariate model created from three gene-expression signatures--termed "germinal-center B-cell," "stromal-1," and "stromal-2"--predicted survival both in patients who received CHOP and patients who received R-CHOP. The prognostically favorable stromal-1 signature reflected extracellular-matrix deposition and histiocytic infiltration. By contrast, the prognostically unfavorable stromal-2 signature reflected tumor blood-vessel density. CONCLUSIONS: Survival after treatment of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is influenced by differences in immune cells, fibrosis, and angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment.},

By integrating copy number data with transcriptional profiles and performing pathway analysis in primary DLBCLs, we identified a comprehensive set of copy number alterations (CNAs) that decreased p53 activity and perturbed cell cycle regulation. Primary tumors either had multiple complementary alterations of p53 and cell cycle components or largely lacked these lesions. DLBCLs with p53 and cell cycle pathway CNAs had decreased abundance of p53 target transcripts and increased expression of E2F target genes and the Ki67 proliferation marker. CNAs of the CDKN2A-TP53-RB-E2F axis provide a structural basis for increased proliferation in DLBCL, predict outcome with current therapy, and suggest targeted treatment approaches.},

Recently, gene expression profiles (GEPs) of B-cell lymphomas based on microarray technologies have contributed significantly to improved sub-classification and diagnostics. However, the varying degrees of malignant B-cell frequencies in analysed samples influence the interpretation of the GEPs. Based on emerging next-generation sequencing technologies (NGS) like tag sequencing (tag-seq) for GEP, it is expected that the detection of mRNA transcripts from malignant B-cells can be supplemented. This study provides a quantitative assessment and comparison of the ability of microarrays and tag-seq to detect mRNA transcripts from malignant B-cells. A model system was established by eight serial dilutions of the malignant B-cell lymphoma cell line, OCI-Ly8, into the embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293, prior to parallel analysis by exon microarrays and tag-seq.},

We used this method to classify diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) biopsy samples into two gene expression subgroups based on data obtained from spotted cDNA microarrays. The germinal center B cell-like (GCB) DLBCL subgroup expressed genes characteristic of normal germinal center B cells whereas the activated B cell-like (ABC) DLBCL subgroup expressed a subset of the genes that are characteristic of plasma cells, particularly those encoding endoplasmic reticulum and golgi proteins involved in secretion. We next used this predictor to discover these subgroups within a second set of DLBCL biopsies that had been profiled by using oligonucleotide microarrays [Shipp, M. A., et al. (2002) Nat. Med. 8, 68-74]. The GCB and ABC DLBCL subgroups identified in this data set had significantly different 5-yr survival rates after multiagent chemotherapy (62\% vs. 26\%; P < or = 0.0051), in accord with analyses of other DLBCL cohorts. These results demonstrate the ability of this gene expression-based predictor to classify DLBCLs into biologically and clinically distinct subgroups irrespective of the method used to measure gene expression.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The distinction between Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma is unclear. We used transcriptional and genomic profiling to define Burkitt's lymphoma more precisely and to distinguish subgroups in other types of mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas. METHODS: We performed gene-expression profiling using Affymetrix U133A GeneChips with RNA from 220 mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas, including a core group of 8 Burkitt's lymphomas that met all World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. A molecular signature for Burkitt's lymphoma was generated, and chromosomal abnormalities were detected with interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization and array-based comparative genomic hybridization. RESULTS: We used the molecular signature for Burkitt's lymphoma to identify 44 cases: 11 had the morphologic features of diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas, 4 were unclassifiable mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas, and 29 had a classic or atypical Burkitt's morphologic appearance. Also, five did not have a detectable IG-myc Burkitt's translocation, whereas the others contained an IG-myc fusion, mostly in simple karyotypes. Of the 176 lymphomas without the molecular signature for Burkitt's lymphoma, 155 were diffuse large-B-cell lymphomas. Of these 155 cases, 21 percent had a chromosomal breakpoint at the myc locus associated with complex chromosomal changes and an unfavorable clinical course. CONCLUSIONS: Our molecular definition of Burkitt's lymphoma clarifies and extends the spectrum of the WHO criteria for Burkitt's lymphoma. In mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas without a gene signature for Burkitt's lymphoma, chromosomal breakpoints at the myc locus were associated with an adverse clinical outcome.},

abstract = {Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common subtype of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, is clinically heterogeneous: 40\% of patients respond well to current therapy and have prolonged survival, whereas the remainder succumb to the disease. We proposed that this variability in natural history reflects unrecognized molecular heterogeneity in the tumours. Using DNA microarrays, we have conducted a systematic characterization of gene expression in B-cell malignancies. Here we show that there is diversity in gene expression among the tumours of DLBCL patients, apparently reflecting the variation in tumour proliferation rate, host response and differentiation state of the tumour. We identified two molecularly distinct forms of DLBCL which had gene expression patterns indicative of different stages of B-cell differentiation. One type expressed genes characteristic of germinal centre B cells ('germinal centre B-like DLBCL'); the second type expressed genes normally induced during in vitro activation of peripheral blood B cells ('activated B-like DLBCL'). Patients with germinal centre B-like DLBCL had a significantly better overall survival than those with activated B-like DLBCL. The molecular classification of tumours on the basis of gene expression can thus identify previously undetected and clinically significant subtypes of cancer.},
